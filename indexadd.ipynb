      "[Document(page_content=\"Operator\\n\\nGreetings and welcome to the Microsoft fiscal year 2024 first quarter earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\\n\\nI would now like to turn the call over to your host, Brett Iversen, vice president of investor relations. Mr. Iversen, please go ahead. \\n\\nBrett Iversen -- General Manager, Investor Relations\\n\\nGood afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, chairman and chief executive officer; Amy Hood, chief financial officer; Alice Jolla, chief accounting officer; and Keith Dolliver, corporate secretary and deputy general counsel. On the Microsoft investor relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. More detailed outlook slides will be available on the Microsoft investor relations website when we provide outlook commentary on today's call.\\n\\nMicrosoft completed the acquisition of Activision Blizzard on October 13, 2023. We will share more on the expected impact of the Activision acquisition during the outlook commentary portion of today's call. On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP items. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\\n\\nThey are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's first quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we'll refer to the growth rate only.\\n\\nWe will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft investor relations website.\\n\\nDuring this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the risk factors section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.\\n\\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya. \\n\\nSatya Nadella -- Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThank you, Brett. We are off to a strong start to the fiscal year driven by the continued strength of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $31.8 billion in quarterly revenue, up 24%. With Copilots, we are making the age of AI real for people and businesses everywhere. We are rapidly infusing AI across every layer of the tech stack and for every role of business process to drive productivity gains for our customers.\\n\\nNow I'll highlight examples of our progress, starting with infrastructure. Azure, again, took share as organizations bring their workloads to our cloud. We have the most comprehensive cloud footprint with more than 60 data center regions worldwide, as well as the best AI infrastructure for both training and inference. And we also have our AI services deployed in more regions than any other cloud provider.\\n\\nThis quarter, we announced the general availability of our next-generation H100 virtual machines. Azure AI provides access to best-in-class frontier models from OpenAI and open-source models, including our own, as well as from Meta and Hugging Face, which customers can use to build their own AI apps while meeting cost, latency, and performance needs. Because of our overall differentiation, more than 18,000 organizations now use Azure OpenAI service, including new-to-Azure customers. And we are expanding our reach with digital-first companies with OpenAI APIs as leading AI start-ups use OpenAI to power their AI solutions, therefore, making them Azure customers as well.\\n\\nWe continue to see more cloud migrations with Azure Arc. We are meeting customers where they are, helping them run apps across on-prem, edge, and multicloud environments. We now have 21,000 Arc customers, up 140% year over year. We are the only other cloud provider to run Oracle's database services, making it simpler for customers to migrate their on-prem Oracle databases to our cloud.\\n\\nCustomers like PepsiCo and Vodafone will have access to a seamless, fully integrated experience for deploying, managing, and using Oracle database instances on Azure. And we are the cloud of choice for customers' SAP workloads to companies like Brother Industries, Hanes, Xis and ZF Group all run SAP on Azure. Now on to data. In the age of Copilots, organizations are looking to consolidate their data estate.\\n\\nThat's why with our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform, we are bringing together operational data stores, analytics, and governance. More than 73% of the Fortune 1000 use three or more of our data solutions today. And with Microsoft Fabric, we are unifying compute, storage, and governance into one end-to-end analytics solution with an all-inclusive business model. More than 16,000 customers are actively using Fabric, including over 50% of the Fortune 500.\\n\\nNow on to developers. With GitHub Copilot, we are increasing developer productivity by up to 55% while helping them stay in the flow and bringing the joy back to coding. We have over 1 million paid Copilot users and more than 37,000 organizations that subscribe to Copilot for business, up 40% quarter over quarter, with significant traction outside the United States. This quarter, we added new capabilities with GitHub Copilot Chat, which are already being used by both digital natives like Shopify, as well as leading enterprises like Maersk and PwC to supercharge the productivity of their software developers.\\n\\nAll of the number of developers using GitHub has increased 4x since our acquisition five years ago. We have also brought Copilot to Power Platform, enabling anyone to use natural language to create apps, build virtual agents, and analyze data. More than 126,000 organizations, including 3M, Equinor, Lumen Technologies, Nationwide, PG&E, and Toyota have all used Copilot and Power Platform to date. EUI, for example, has enabled Copilot for all 170,000-plus Power Platform users at the company.\\n\\nAnd this quarter, we added new Copilot capabilities to Power Pages, making it possible to build data-driven websites using just a few sentences or clicks. Finally, Power Apps remains the market leader in low-code, no-code development now with 20 million monthly active users up 40% year over year. Now on to business applications. All our Dynamics 365 took share for the 10th consecutive quarter.\\n\\nWe're using this AI inflection point to redefine our role in business applications. We are becoming the Copilot-led business process transformation layer on top of existing CRM systems like Salesforce. For example, our sales Copilot helps sellers at more than 15,000 organizations, including Rockwell Automation, Sandvik Coromant, Securitas, and Teleperformance personalize customer interactions based on data from third-party CRMs. We're also bringing Copilot to Dynamics 365 to help with everything from suggested actions and content ideas to faster access to valuable business data.\\n\\nAnd this quarter, we introduced Copilot and Dynamics 365 Field Service to help streamline frontline tasks. Now on to industry and cross-industry clouds. In healthcare, our Dragon Ambient eXperience solution helps clinicians automatically document patient interactions at the point of care. It's been used across more than 10 million interactions to date.\\n\\nAnd with DAX Copilot, we are applying generative models to draft high-quality clinical notes in seconds, increasing physician productivity and reducing burnout. For example, Atrium Health, a leading provider in Southeast United States, credits DAX Copilot with helping its physicians each save up to 40 minutes per day in documentation time. We're also introducing healthcare data solutions in Microsoft Fabric, enabling providers like Northwestern Medicine and Sing Health to unify health data in a secure, compliant way. And with our Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty, which will become generally available by the end of the calendar year, we offer industry-leading data sovereignty and encryption controls, meeting the specific needs of public sector customers around the world.\\n\\nNow on to future work. Copilot is your everyday AI assistant, helping you be more creative in Word, more analytical in Excel, more expressive in PowerPoint, more productive in Outlook and more collaborative in Teams. Tens of thousands of employees at customers like Bayer, KPMG, Mayo Clinic, Suncorp and Visa, including 40% of the Fortune 100, are using Copilot as part of our early access program. Customers tell us that once they use Copilot, they can't imagine work without it, and we are excited to make it generally available for enterprise customers next week.\\n\\nThis quarter, we also introduced a new hero experience in Copilot, helping employees tap into their entire universe of work, data, and knowledge using chat. And the new Copilot lab helps employees build their own work habits for this era of AI by helping them turn good prompts into great ones. When it comes to Teams, usage continues to grow with more than 320 million monthly active users, making Teams the place to work across chat, collaboration, meetings, and calling. This quarter, we introduced a new version of Teams that is up to two times faster while using 50% less memory and includes seamless cross-tenant communications and collaboration.\\n\\nWe have seen nine consecutive quarters of triple-digit revenue growth for Teams Rooms, and more than 10,000 paid customers now use Teams Premium. Teams has also become a multiplayer canvas for business process. There are more than 2,000 apps in Teams store and collaborative apps from Adobe, Atlassian, and Workday each exceeded 1 million monthly active users on Teams. And with Viva, we have created a new market category for employee experience, helping companies like Dell, Lloyds Banking Group, and PayPal build high-performance organizations.\\n\\nWith skills in Viva, we are bringing together information from Microsoft 365 and LinkedIn to help employers understand workforce gaps and suggest personalized learning content to address it, all in the flow of work. All up, we continue to see more organizations choose Microsoft 365 in companies across private and public sector, including Cerberus, Chanel, DXC Technology, all rely on our premium E5 offerings for advanced security, compliance, voice, and analytics. Now on to Windows. The PC market unit volumes were at roughly pre-pandemic levels.\\n\\nAnd we continue to innovate across Windows, adding differentiated AI-powered experiences to the operating system. We rolled out the biggest update to Windows 11 ever with 150 new features, including new AI-powered experiences like Clipchamp, Paint and Photos. And we introduced Copilot in Windows, the Everyday AI companion, which incorporates the context of the web, your work data, and what you are doing on the PC to provide better assistance. We are seeing accelerated Windows 11 deployments worldwide from companies like BP, Eurowings, Kantar, and RBC.\\n\\nFinally, with Windows 365 Boot and Switch, we are making it easier than ever for employees at companies like Crocs, Hamburg Commercial Bank, and the ING Bank to get a personalized Windows 365 Cloud PC with Copilot on any device. Now on to security. The speed, scale, and sophistication of cyberattacks today is unparalleled, and security is the No. 1 priority for CIOs worldwide.\\n\\nWe see high demand for Security Copilot, the industry's first and most advanced generative AI product, which is now seamlessly integrated with Microsoft 365 Defender. Dozens of organizations, including Bridgewater, Fidelity National Financial, and Government of Alberta, have been using Copilot in preview and early feedback has been positive. And we look forward to bringing Copilot to hundreds of organizations in the coming months as part of the new early access program so they can improve the productivity of their own security operation centers and stop threats at machine speed. More broadly, we continue to take share across all major categories we serve.\\n\\nAnd our SIEM Microsoft Sentinel now has more than 25,000 customers and revenues past $1 billion annual run rate. And customers in every industry like Booz Allen Hamilton, Grant Thorton, and MetLife use our end-to-end solutions to protect their environment. Now on to LinkedIn. We are now applying this new generation of AI to transform how the 985 million members learn, sell, and get hired.\\n\\nMembership growth has now accelerated each quarter for over two years in a row. This quarter, we introduced new AI-driven features across all of our businesses, including a learning coach that gives members personalized content guidelines and tools to help employers find qualified candidates and sellers and marketeers attract buyers in a single step. Since introducing AI-assisted messages for recruiters five months ago, three-fourths of them say it saves them time. And we have seen a nearly 80% increase in members watching AI-related learning courses this quarter.\\n\\nMore broadly, we continue to see record engagement and knowledge sharing on the platform. We now have more than 450 million newsletter subscriptions globally, up 3x year over year. Premium subscription sign-ups were up 55% year over year, and our hiring business took share for the fifth consecutive quarter. Now on to search advertising and news.\\n\\nWith our Copilots for the web, we are redefining how people use the Internet to search and create. Bing users have engaged in more than 1.9 billion chats, and Microsoft Edge has now gained share for 10 consecutive quarters. This quarter, we introduced new personalized answers, as well as support for DALL·E 3, helping people get more relevant answers and to create incredibly realistic images. More than 1.8 billion images have been created to date.\\n\\nAnd with our Copilot in shopping, people can find more tailored recommendations and better deals. We're also expanding to new end points, bringing Bing to Meta's AI chat experience in order to provide more up-to-date answers, as well as access to real-time search information. Finally, we are integrating this new generation of AI directly into our ad platforms to more effectively connect marketeers to customer intent and chat experiences both from us, as well as customers like Axel Springer and Snap. Now on to gaming.\\n\\nWe were delighted to close our acquisition of Activision Blizzard King earlier this month. Together, we will advance our goal of bringing great games to players everywhere on any end point. Already with Game Pass, we are redefining how games are distributed, played, and discovered. We set a record for hours played per subscriber this quarter.\\n\\nPrerelease stuff fill this quarter to broad acclaim. More than 11 million people have played the game to date. Nearly half of the hours played have been on PC and on launch day, we set a record for the most Game Pass subscriptions added on a single day ever. Minecraft has now surpassed 300 million copies sold and with Activision Blizzard King, we now add significant depth to our content portfolio.\\n\\nWe will have $13 billion-plus franchises from Candy Crush, Diablo, and Halo to Warcraft, Elder Scrolls, and Gears of War. And we're looking forward to one of our strongest first-party holiday lineup ever, including new titles like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Forza Motorsport. In closing, we are rapidly innovating to expand our opportunity across our consumer and commercial businesses as we help our customers thrive in this new era. In just a few weeks, we'll be holding our flagship Ignite Conference, where we will introduce more than 100 new products and capabilities, including exciting new AI innovations.\\n\\nI encourage you to tune in. With that, I'll turn it over to Amy. \\n\\nAmy Hood -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $56.5 billion, up 13% and 12% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.99 and increased 27% and 26% in constant currency. Consistent execution by our sales teams and partners have a strong start to the fiscal year.\\n\\nResults exceeded expectations, and we saw share gains again this quarter across many businesses as customers adopt our innovative solutions to transform their businesses. In our commercial business, the trends from the prior quarter continued. We saw healthy renewals, particularly in Microsoft 365 E5, and growth of new business continued to be moderated for stand-alone products sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite. In Azure, as expected, the optimization trends were similar to Q4.\\n\\nHigher-than-expected AI consumption contributed to revenue growth in Azure. In our consumer business, PC market unit volumes are returning to pre-pandemic levels. Advertising spend landed roughly in line with our expectations. And in gaming, strong engagement helped by the Starfield launch benefited Xbox content and services.\\n\\nCommercial bookings increased 14% and 17% in constant currency, in line with expectations, primarily driven by strong execution across our core annuity sales motion with continued growth in the number of $10 million-plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 18% to $212 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 15% year over year. The remaining portion, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 20%.\\n\\nAnd this quarter, our annuity mix was 96%. FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment-level revenue, COGS, and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $31.8 billion and grew 24% and 23% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased slightly year over year to 73%, a point better than expected, primarily driven by improvement in Azure.\\n\\nExcluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points driven by the improvement just mentioned in Azure, as well as Office 365, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. Company gross margin dollars increased 16% and 15% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased year over year to 71%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 3 points driven by the improvement in Azure and Office 365, as well as sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 1%, lower than expected due to cost efficiency focus, as well as investments that shifted to future quarters.\\n\\nOperating expense growth was driven by marketing, LinkedIn, and cloud engineering, partially offset by devices. At a total company level, headcount at the end of September was 7% lower than a year ago. Operating income increased 25% and 24% in constant currency. Operating margins increased roughly 5 points year over year to 48%.\\n\\nExcluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased roughly 6 points driven by improved operating leverage through cost management and the higher gross margin noted earlier. Now to our segment results. Revenue from productivity and business processes was $18.6 billion and grew 13% and 12% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected results in Office 365 commercial and LinkedIn. Office commercial revenue grew 15% and 14% in constant currency.\\n\\nOffice 365 commercial revenue increased 18% and 17% in constant currency, slightly better than expected with a bit more in-period revenue recognition, while billings remained relatively in line with expectations. Growth continues to be driven by healthy renewal execution and ARPU growth as E5 momentum remains strong. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 10% year over year with installed base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings with continued impact from the growth trends in new stand-alone business noted earlier.\\n\\nOffice commercial licensing declined 17%, in line with the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Office consumer revenue increased 3% and 4% in constant currency with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 18% to $76.7 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 8%, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better-than-expected performance across all businesses. Growth was driven by Talent Solutions, though we continue to see negative year-over-year bookings there from the weaker hiring environment in key verticals.\\n\\nDynamics revenue grew 22% and 21% in constant currency driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 28% and 26% in constant currency with continued growth across all workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and gross margin percentage increased slightly year over year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point driven by improvement in Office 365. Operating expenses increased 2% and operating income increased 20% and 19% in constant currency.\\n\\nNext, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $24.3 billion, increasing 19% and ahead of expectations with better-than-expected results across all businesses. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue grew 21%. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 29% and 28% in constant currency, including roughly 3 points from AI services.\\n\\nWhile the trends from prior quarter continued, growth was ahead of expectations primarily driven by increased GPU capacity and better-than-expected GPU utilization of our AI services, as well as slightly higher-than-expected growth in our per-user business. In our per-user business, the Enterprise Mobility and Security install base grew 11% to over 259 million seats with continued impact from the growth trends in new stand-alone business noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 2%, ahead of expectations, driven primarily by demand in advance of Windows Server 2012 end of support. Enterprise and partner services revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected performance in enterprise support services.\\n\\nSegment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 19% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased slightly. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points, driven by the improvement in Azure noted earlier, even as we scale our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. Operating expenses increased 2% and 1% in constant currency. Operating income grew 31% and 30% in constant currency.\\n\\nNow to more personal computing. Revenue was $13.7 billion, increasing 3% and 2% in constant currency, above expectations with better-than-expected results across all businesses. Windows OEM revenue increased 4% year over year, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by stronger-than-expected consumer channel inventory builds and the stabilizing PC market demand noted earlier, particularly in commercial. Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 8%, driven by demand for Microsoft 365 E5.\\n\\nDevices revenue decreased 22%, ahead of expectations due to stronger execution in the commercial segment. Search and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 10% and 9% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations. We saw increased engagement on Bing and Edge share gains again this quarter, although search revenue growth continues to be impacted by a third-party partnership. And in gaming.\\n\\nRevenue increased 9% and 8% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected subscriber growth in Xbox Game Pass, as well as first-party content, primarily due to the Starfield launch. Xbox content and services revenue increased 13% and 12% in constant currency, and Xbox hardware revenue declined 7% and 8% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 12% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased roughly 5 points year over year, driven primarily by sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses. Operating expenses declined 1%, and operating income increased 23% and 22% in constant currency.\\n\\nNow back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $11.2 billion to support cloud demand, including investments to scale our AI infrastructure. Cash paid for PP&E was $9.9 billion. Cash flow from operations was $30.6 billion, up 32% year over year, driven by strong cloud billings and collections.\\n\\nFree cash flow was $20.7 billion, up 22% year over year. This quarter, other income and expense was $389 million, higher than anticipated, driven by interest income, partially offset by net losses on investments and foreign currency remeasurement. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%. And finally, we returned $9.1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.\\n\\nNow moving to our Q2 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. The Activision acquisition closed on October 13. So, my commentary includes the net impact of the deal from the date of acquisition.\\n\\nOur outlook includes purchase accounting impact, integration and transaction-related expenses based on our current understanding of the purchase price allocation and related deal accounting. The net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first party. Now to FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue and segment-level revenue growth by approximately 1 point.\\n\\nWe expect FX to have no impact to COGS and operating expense growth. In commercial bookings, we expect consistent execution across our core annuity sales motion, including healthy renewals, but growth will be impacted by a low-growth expiry base. Therefore, we expect bookings growth to be relatively flat. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be relatively flat year over year.\\n\\nExcluding the impact from the accounting estimate change, Q2 cloud gross margin percentage will be up roughly 1 point, primarily driven by improvement in Azure and Office 365, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase sequentially on a dollar basis, driven by investments in our cloud and AI infrastructure. As a reminder, there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure buildout. Next to segment guidance.\\n\\nIn productivity and business processes, we expect revenue to grow between 11% and 12% or USD 18.8 billion to USD 19.1 billion. Growth in constant currency will be approximately 1 point lower. In Office commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be up roughly 16% in constant currency.\\n\\nWe're excited for Microsoft 365 Copilot general availability on November 1 and expect the related revenue to grow gradually over time. In our on-premise business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid- to high teens. In Office consumer, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits, driven by Talent Solutions and Marketing Solutions.\\n\\nGrowth continues to be impacted by the overall market environments for recruiting and advertising, especially in the technology industry where we have significant exposure. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the high teens driven by Dynamics 365. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 17% and 18% or USD 25.1 billion to USD 25.4 billion. Revenue growth in constant currency will be approximately 1 point lower.\\n\\nRevenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect revenue growth to be 26% to 27% in constant currency with an increasing contribution from AI. Growth continues to be driven by Azure consumption business, and we expect the trends from Q1 to continue into Q2. Our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect continued moderation in seat growth rates given the size of the installed base.\\n\\nFor H2, assuming the optimization and new workload trends continue and with the growing contribution from AI, we expect Azure revenue growth in constant currency to remain roughly stable compared to Q2. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth to be roughly flat with continued hybrid demand, particularly from licenses running in multi-cloud environments. In enterprise and partner services, revenue should decline low to mid-single digits. Now to more personal computing, which includes the net impact from the Activision acquisition.\\n\\nWe expect revenue of USD 16.5 billion to USD 16.9 billion. Windows OEM revenue growth should be mid- to high single digits with PC market unit volumes expected to look roughly similar to Q1. In devices, revenue should decline in the mid-teens as we continue to focus on our higher-margin premium products. In Windows Commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive revenue growth in the low to mid-teens.\\n\\nSearch and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be mid-single digits with roughly 4 points of negative impact from a third-party partnership. Growth should be driven by volume strength supported by Edge browser share gains and increasing Bing engagement as we expect the advertising spend environment to be similar to Q1. Reminder that this ex TAC growth will be roughly 4 points higher than overall search and news advertising revenue. And in gaming, we expect revenue growth in the mid- to high 40s.\\n\\nThis includes roughly 35 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition, which, as a reminder, includes adjusting for the third-party to first-party content change noted earlier. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the mid- to high 50s, driven by roughly 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS between USD 19.4 billion to USD 19.6 billion, including approximately $500 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets from the Activision acquisition.\\n\\nWe expect operating expense of USD 15.5 billion to USD 15.6 billion, including approximately $400 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Other income and expense should be roughly negative $500 million as interest income will be more than offset by interest expense, primarily due to a reduction in our investment portfolio balance and the issuance of short-term debt, both for the Activision acquisition. As a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%.\\n\\nNow some additional thoughts on H2, as well as the full fiscal year. First, FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to have no meaningful impact to full year revenue COGS or operating expense growth. Therefore, in H2, we expect FX to decrease revenue COGS and operating expense growth by 1 point.\\n\\nSecond, Activision. We expect approximately $900 million for purchase accounting adjustments, as well as integration and transaction-related costs in each quarter in H2. For our full FY '24, we remain committed to investing for the cloud and AI opportunity while also maintaining our disciplined focus on operating leverage. Therefore, as we add the net impact of Activision, inclusive of purchase accounting adjustments, as well as integration and transaction-related expenses, we continue to expect full year operating margins to remain flat year over year.\\n\\nIn closing, with our strong start to FY '24, I am confident that as a team, we will continue to deliver healthy growth in the year ahead, driven by our leadership in commercial cloud and our commitment to lead the AI platform wave. With that, let's go to Q&A, Brett. \\n\\nBrett Iversen -- General Manager, Investor Relations\\n\\nThanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request to participants to please ask only one question. Joe, can you please repeat your instructions?\\n\\nQuestions & Answers:\\n\\nOperator\\n\\n[Operator instructions] One moment please while we poll for questions. Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\\n\\nKeith Weiss -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\\n\\nExcellent. Thank you for taking the question, and very nice quarter. The pace of innovation you guys have been putting out has been pretty amazing. And new products are like garnering traction probably faster than we had expected on our side of the equation.\\n\\nBut we're also working in an overall spending environment that remains volatile at that, and I think investors are getting more concerned on it. So, two questions on this. One, based on sort of the new products and the innovation, do you think you guys can sustain the type of commercial growth that we saw in Q1 as we go through the year? Or is the environment too tricky for that? And then when it relates to investment, Amy, you've been able to keep overall opex growth very low, and it was very low this quarter. At some point, should we be thinking about a return to a more aggressive investment behind all this product innovation? \\n\\nSatya Nadella -- Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nMaybe I can start, Keith, and Amy, you can add to it. Overall, there are multiple things, Keith, that are all happening, obviously, simultaneously. If you just take Azure and try to characterize where is the growth for Azure coming from or what sort of drivers for Azure numbers, there are three things all happening in parallel. Like, for example, take cloud migrations.\\n\\nA good reminder of where we are and even the core cloud migration story is the new Oracle announcement. Once we announce that the Oracle databases are going to be available on Azure, we saw a bunch of unlock from new customers who have significant Oracle estates that have not yet moved to the cloud because they needed to run the GUI with the rest of the app estate in one single cloud. And so, we're excited about that. So, in some sense, even the financial services sector, for example, is a good place where there's a lot of Oracle that still needs to move to the cloud.\\n\\nSecond thing, of course, is the workloads start, then workloads get optimized and then new workloads start. And that cycle continues. We'll lap some of those optimization cycles that were fairly extreme perhaps in the second half of our fiscal. And the third thing is, for us, that's unique and different is new workload starts around AI.\\n\\nGiven our leadership position, we are seeing complete new project starts, which are AI projects. And as you know, AI projects are not just about AI meters. They have lots of other cloud meters as well. So, that sort of gives you one side of what's happening in terms of enterprise.\\n\\nThe other piece is on the SaaS side. Obviously, again, this is a new product that's going to go through the enterprise adoption cycle. The results are on productivity, which we demonstrated with GitHub Copilot is what's giving us good confidence and our customers, more importantly, good confidence around what these products represent in terms of value. And so, we are in the very, very early innings there.\\n\\nAnd so, we look forward to seeing the traction for these products going forward. \\n\\nAmy Hood -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nKeith, maybe just a few things to add, and then I'll talk a little bit about the operating leverage, which is the second part of your question. In general, we saw very consistent execution from Q4 to Q1, and that's what we're talking about into Q2. I think that speaks to our value prop, which is where Satya went. It speaks to making sure that customers are getting a very quick return on value, real productivity improvement, real savings so that when we're asking at renewal or talking about E5 upgrades or talking about AI services that those come with real promises of high-value scenarios.\\n\\nAnd so, I think that is an important piece as you think about stability in commercial demand. And then if you think about the nature of your question, it was partially why I talked about in my full year guidance that now even with the addition of Activision and purchase accounting impacts, integration impacts, we still feel confident we can deliver consistent operating margins to last year. And it speaks to, I think, some of the improvements we're making in Azure and even Microsoft 365 gross margins, even in the core of the commercial cloud. It speaks to the pace at which we are delivering AI revenue with the increasing cost expense and capital investment ahead with the demand we see.\\n\\nAnd although you're right, our operating expense comparables in H2 get more challenging than in H1, we're really focused on making sure that every dollar we put and commit is back to the priorities we talked about, which is commercial cloud leadership and leading the AI wave. And so, I think that focus is really helping on both execution and leverage.\\n\\nKeith Weiss -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\\n\\nExcellent. Thank you, guys.\\n\\nBrett Iversen -- General Manager, Investor Relations\\n\\nThanks, Keith. Joe, next question, please.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nThe next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.\\n\\nMark Moerdler -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst\\n\\nThank you very much and congratulations on a really strong quarter. AI has been far stronger than expected, beat your guidance for Azure this quarter. And while you discussed higher utilization and more GPUs have helped, has the fact that Microsoft has a full AI dev stack, Copilot reference architecture and plug-in architecture, been a meaningful factor not just from a revenue perspective, but also even potentially from a margin perspective? In addition, can you give us any color on whether Azure GPU is predominantly model training? Or are we seeing a lot of inferencing yet from clients? Thanks. \\n\\nSatya Nadella -- Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nOK. Thank you for the question, Mark. Yes, it is true that we have -- the approach we have taken is a full-stack approach all the way from whether it's ChatGPT or Bing chat or all our Copilots all share the same model. So, in some sense, one of the things that we do have is very, very high leverage of the one model that we used, which we trained, and then the one model that we are doing inferencing at scale.\\n\\nAnd that advantage sort of trickles down all the way to both utilization internally, utilization of third parties. And also over time, you can see that sort of stack optimization all the way to the silicon because the abstraction layer to which the developers are riding is much higher up than no-level kernels, if you will. So, therefore, I think there is a fundamental approach we took, which was a technical approach of saying we'll have Copilots and Copilot stack all available. That doesn't mean we don't have people doing training for open-source models or proprietary models.\\n\\nWe also have a bunch of open-source models. We have a bunch of fine-tuning happening, a bunch of RLHF happening. So, there's all kinds of ways people use it, but the thing is we have scale leverage of one large model that was trained and one large model that's been used for inference across all our first-party SaaS apps, as well as our API in our Azure AI service.\\n\\nAmy Hood -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nAnd the reason, Mark, that's important is that it means, even beyond the point Satya made, is that when it comes to our ability to leverage the infrastructure that we're building out, we don't really have a preference in terms of how people are utilizing that infrastructure, whether it's through all the means that Satya mentioned. It gives us a good opportunity to see quick conversion into revenue. \\n\\nSatya Nadella -- Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. I mean one other thing I would just add to perhaps Mark's question, as well as Keith's is in a -- this platform transition, I think, is very important for us to be very disciplined on both I'll call it our tech stack, as well as our capital spend all to be concentrated. The lesson learned from the cloud side is this, we're not running a conglomerate of different businesses. It's all one tech stack up and down Microsoft's portfolio.\\n\\nAnd that I think is going to be very important because that discipline, given what the spend like -- it will look like for this AI transition, any business that's not disciplined about their capital spend accruing across all their businesses could run into trouble.\\n\\nMark Moerdler -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst\\n\\nExtremely helpful. Thank you so much.\\n\\nBrett Iversen -- General Manager, Investor Relations\\n\\nThanks, Mark. Joe, next question, please.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nThe next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed. \\n\\nBrent Thill -- Jefferies -- Analyst\\n\\nThanks. Amy, good to see the 12% growth. Many investors are asking can you sustain double-digit growth, especially with the stronger AI boost coming in the next several quarters. \\n\\nAmy Hood -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nI think looking at our -- as I said, Q1 was a strong start to the year. Q2 certainly implies that. We talked about stability for Azure into the second half of the year looking at -- and in line with what we're seeing for Q2. And so, I think we feel good about our ability to execute, but more importantly, our ability to continue to take share.\\n\\nBrett Iversen -- General Manager, Investor Relations\\n\\nThanks, Brent Joe. Next question, please.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nThe next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed. \\n\\nRaimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- Analyst\\n\\nHey, thank you. You sound very optimistic about the opportunity in the Office space with Copilot coming out now very soon. Can you speak a little bit about the -- what you're seeing there in the customer base that tested this already in terms of how excited they were, the special features there? And what does it mean in terms of adoption curve for that going forward once you go GA in 1st of November? Thank you. \\n\\nSatya Nadella -- Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nNo, thanks for the question, Raimo. The good news is twofold. One is the fact that, what, 40% of the Fortune 100 are already in the preview and are using the product. And I think you all have also done lots of checks.\\n\\nAnd the feedback is very, very positive. And in fact, the interesting thing is it's not any one tool, right, which is the feedback even sort of is very clear that it's the all up. You just keep hitting the Copilot button across every surface, right, whether it's in Word to create documents, in Excel to do analysis or PowerPoint or Outlook or Teams. Like clearly, the Teams Meeting, which is an intelligent recap, right? It's not just a dumb transcript.\\n\\nIt's like having a knowledge base of all your meetings that you can query and add to essentially the knowledge terms of your enterprise. And so, we are seeing broad usage across and the interesting thing is by different functions, whether it's in finance or in sales by roles. We have seen productivity gains like we saw with developers in GitHub Copilot. So, that's the data.\\n\\nWe are very excited about our Ignite Conference, where we will talk a lot more about all of the use cases and where's the value and give more prescriptive guidance on how people can deploy. But so far so good as far as the data is and the feedback is. And of course, this is an enterprise product. I mean at the end of the day, we are grounded on enterprise cycle times in terms of adoption and ramp.\\n\\nAnd it's incrementally priced. So, therefore, that all will apply still. But at least for something completely new, to have this level of usage already and this level of excitement is something we're very, very pleased with.\\n\\nRaimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- Analyst\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nBrett Iversen -- General Manager, Investor Relations\\n\\nThanks, Raimo. Joe, next question, please.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nNext question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed.\\n\\nKarl Keirstead -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nOK, great. Thanks. Amy, congrats on the 28% constant currency Azure growth. That's terrific.\\n\\nI wanted to press you a little bit on the outlook for Azure. You're obviously guiding to a 1- to 2-point decel in December and then stable thereafter. But why would it be stable? Why wouldn't it accelerate in the second half of your fiscal year if the AI contribution is increasing as you bring on more GPU capacity? Is this a function of perhaps continued core ex-AI Azure spend optimization continuing or maybe even getting slightly worse? Why couldn't we see some upside in that Azure number? I know you're trying to be conservative, but I'd just love to understand it. Thanks so much.\\n\\nAmy Hood -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThanks, Karl. A couple of things as I talked about Q2 and then into H2. We've been very consistent that the optimization trends have been consistent for us through a couple of quarters now. Customers are going to continue to do that.\\n\\nIt's an important part of running workloads. That is not new. There obviously were some quarters where it was more accelerated. But that is a pattern that is and has been a fundamental part of having customers, both make new room for new workload adoption and continue to build new capabilities.\\n\\nAnd so, I think that impact remains through the rest of the year, and my view is unchanged on that. And then, of course, I think the key component has always been new workload starts. And at the scale we're talking about, being able to have stability in our Azure business does mean that we will have a lot of new workload starts. And primarily, we're expecting those to come from AI workloads.\\n\\nBut AI workloads don't just use our AI services. They use data services and they use other things. And so, that combination, I think, looking on a competitive basis, we feel good about our execution, we feel good about taking share, and we feel good about consistent trends. And so, I feel good about that guide and what it says about where we are on share.\\n\\nKarl Keirstead -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nTerrific, thanks.\\n\\nBrett Iversen -- General Manager, Investor Relations\\n\\nThanks, Karl. Joe, next question, please.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nThe next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed. \\n\\nBrad Sills -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\n\\nOh, wonderful. Thank you so much. Very impressive to see the Office 365 Commercial seat growth hanging in here in that double-digit range. It's very impressive just given the scale of that business, we think of Office as having such a dominant market position.\\n\\nCurious how you think about the -- where that seat is coming from and how many more of those seats are out there to go get.\\n\\nAmy Hood -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThanks for that question. Maybe I'll take that. Satya, if you want to add. In general, our seat growth has -- it does come from all segments but with a particular strength in small and midsized businesses, as well as what we call the frontline worker opportunity.\\n\\nAnd then that has been, I would say, looking back a number of quarters, where the majority of our seat growth has gone. And while obviously, it's slowed a bit, to your point, I think the fact that we're still able to add seats at this level speaks to the broadening nature of what Microsoft 365 needs. It's more applicable to more people. And so, I think many people have thought, oh, my goodness, you've got a lot of customers already.\\n\\nAnd we look and say, how many people when you expand what Microsoft 365 means, whether it's security or it means analytics or it means Teams, it means lots of things and an expanding definition, it applies to more types of workers. And frankly, the value is such, especially on the small business front, where it's to the point where I think people feel like it's a great way to spend even the spend money they have is this remains a pretty compelling offer.\\n\\nBrad Sills -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nBrett Iversen -- General Manager, Investor Relations\\n\\nThanks, Brad. Joe, next question, please.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nThe next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Please proceed.\\n\\nBrent Bracelin -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\\n\\nThank you. Good afternoon. One thing that really stood out to me was the intelligent cloud segment operating margin. These came in, I think, at the highest level in six years despite elevated AI investments.\\n\\nWas there a one-time tailwind here that helped? Or are you at the point where Azure has got to kind of scale where Microsoft could sustain high margins even with an ambitious AI investment cycle?\\n\\nAmy Hood -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThanks for that question. I think there are a couple of things going on. I would say, in particular, this was a very good leverage quarter in that segment. Number one, the Azure revenue growth and the stability we're seeing in it absolutely is a help to operating leverage.\\n\\nThe second component of that is our core Azure business. The team continues to deliver thoughtful gross margin improvement across both technical decisions, software implementations. Our teams on the infrastructure build side have done really good work to deliver that. And so, that's been helpful as well.\\n\\nAnd then, of course, on operating expenses, there's been a good focus on continuing even within that segment to make sure we're focusing that work leading in the AI transition with Azure. And so, you're right, even as we're investing in AI infrastructure, which will and should show up as revenue, it will also show up in COGS and still deliver good margin. But this does have a slightly, as I talked about earlier, easier comp in Q1 and Q2 given it was some of our highest growth operating expense quarters in our company's history a year ago.\\n\\nBrent Bracelin -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\\n\\nMakes sense. Thank you.\\n\\nBrett Iversen -- General Manager, Investor Relations\\n\\nThanks, Brent. Joe, we have time for one last question.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nThe last question will come from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Please proceed.\\n\\nGregg Moskowitz -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst\\n\\nOK. Thank you very much for taking the question. Maybe just a follow-up to what Brent was just asking about but on the gross margin line. Amy, the Microsoft Cloud gross margin is up 2 points year over year, excluding the useful life change, a little more improvement than we've seen in some time.\\n\\nAnd some investors were worried that it might go in the other direction given increased AI investments. And so, as you look forward, do you think that you could drive some continued gross margin improvement over the medium term and even as higher capex will filter into the model? Thanks.\\n\\nAmy Hood -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYeah. Let me break that into two components because they're both important, and it's a really good question, Gregg. On our core business, the core Azure business, the core Office 365, M365 Business Dynamics business, they continue to deliver gross margin year-over-year improvements in the core. And so, that, like in other quarters, has helped this quarter.\\n\\nIn addition, what Satya mentioned earlier in a question, and I just want to take every chance to reiterate it, if you have a consistent infrastructure from the platform all the way up through its layers that every capital dollar we spend, if we optimize revenue against it, we will have great leverage because wherever demand shows up in the layers, whether it's at the SaaS layer, whether it's at the infrastructure layer, whether it's for training workloads, we're able to quickly put our infrastructure to work generating revenue on our Bing workloads. I mean I should have mentioned all the consumer workloads use the same frame. And so, when you think about our investment in AI, yes, it will -- because we're committed to leading this wave and see demand, you will see that impact in COGS growth. But what we're committed to doing is making sure it's highly leveraged and making sure you see the same growth in revenue.\\n\\nAnd I think on occasion, you may see something tick up 1 or 2 points and the other one not quite get there. But the point is it's going to be very well pared because of the choices we've made over the past, frankly, numerous years to get to a point where that infrastructure is consistent.\\n\\nSatya Nadella -- Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAnd I'll just add that it will be very well pared at the company level. I realize all of you care a lot about each one of our segments and each one of our KPIs, and I do too. But at the end of the day, our stack and the way it works, the way we do our capital allocation, the way we think about even the optimization of the demand to utilization, is across the entirety of all of our segments and all of our products.\\n\\nGregg Moskowitz -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst\\n\\nVery helpful. Thank you.\\n\\nBrett Iversen -- General Manager, Investor Relations\\n\\nThanks, Gregg. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.\\n\\nAmy Hood -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nSatya Nadella -- Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThank you.\", metadata={'source': 'MSFT_q1_2024.txt'})]\n",

We will also provide growth rates and constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying business is performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations.\\n\\nWhere growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only. We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording.\\n\\nYou can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft investor relations website. During this call, we'll be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\\n\\nWe do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\\n\\nSatya Nadella -- Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThank you, Brett. It was a record quarter, driven by the continued strength of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $33 billion in revenue, up 24%. We move from talking about AI to applying AI at scale. By infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we are winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains.\\n\\nNow, I'll highlight examples of our momentum and progress, starting with Azure. Azure again took share this quarter with our AI Advantage. Azure offers the top performance for AI training and inference in the most diverse selection of AI accelerators, including the latest from AMD and NVIDIA, as well as our own first-party silicon, Azure Maia. And with Azure AI, we provide access to the best selection of foundation and open-source models, including both LLMs and SLMs, all integrated deeply with infrastructure data and tools on Azure.\\n\\nWe now have 53,000 Azure AI customers. Over one-third are new to Azure over the past 12 months. Our new models-as-a-service offering makes it easy for developers to use LLMs from our partners, like Cohere, Meta, and Mistral, on Azure without having to manage underlying infrastructure. We have also built the world's most popular SLMs, which offer performance comparable to larger models but are small enough to run on a laptop or mobile device.\\n\\nAnker, Ashley, AT&T, EY, and Thomson Reuters, for example, are all already exploring how to use our SLM Phi for their applications, and we have great momentum with Azure OpenAI Service. This quarter, we added support for OpenAI's latest models, including GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4 with Vision, DALL-E 3, as well as fine-tuning. We are seeing increased usage from AI-first start-ups, like Moveworks, Perplexity, SymphonyAI, as well as some of the world's largest companies. Over half of the Fortune 500 use Azure OpenAI today, including Ally Financial, Coca-Cola, and Rockwell Automation.\\n\\nFor example, at CES this month, Walmart shared how it's using Azure OpenAI Service, along with its own proprietary data and models, to streamline how more than 50,000 associates work and transform how its millions of customers shop. More broadly, customers continue to choose Azure to simplify and accelerate their cloud migrations. Overall, we are seeing larger and more strategic Azure deals with an increase in the number of billion-dollar-plus Azure commitments. Vodafone, for example, will invest $1.5 billion in cloud and AI services over the next 10 years as it works to transform the digital experience of more than 300 million customers worldwide.\\n\\nNow on to data. We are integrating the power of AI across the entire data stack. Our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform brings together operational databases, analytics, governance, and AI to help organizations simplify and consolidate their data estates. Cosmos DB is the go-to database to build AI-powered apps at any scale, powering workloads for companies in every industry, from AXA and Kohl's to Mitsubishi and TomTom.\\n\\nKPMG, for example, has used Cosmos DB, including its built-in native vector search capabilities, along with Azure OpenAI service, to power an AI assistant, which it credits with driving an up to 50% increase in productivity for its consultants. All up, Cosmos DB data transactions increased 42% year over year. And for those organizations who want to go beyond in-database vector search, Azure AI search offers the best hybrid search solution. OpenAI is using it for retrieval augmented generation as part of ChatGPT.\\n\\nAnd this quarter, we made Microsoft Fabric generally available, helping customers, like Milman and PwC, go from data to insights to action, all within the same unified SaaS solution. Data stored in Fabric's multi-cloud data lake, OneLake, increased 46% quarter over quarter. Now on to developers. From GitHub to Visual Studio, we have the most comprehensive and loved developer tools for the era of AI.\\n\\nGitHub revenue accelerated to over 40% year over year, driven by all our platform growth and adoption of GitHub Copilot, the world's most widely deployed AI developer tool. We now have over 1.3 million paid GitHub Copilot subscribers, up 30% quarter over quarter, and more than 50,000 organizations use GitHub Copilot business to supercharge the productivity of their developers from digital natives like Etsy and HelloFresh to leading enterprises like Autodesk, Dell Technologies, and Goldman Sachs. Accenture alone will rollout GitHub Copilot to 50,000 of its developers this year and we're going further making Copilot ubiquitous across the entire GitHub platform and new AI-powered security features, as well as Copilot enterprise, which tailors Copilot to organization's code bases and allows developers to converse with it in natural language. We're also the leader in low-code no-code development helping everyone create apps, automate workflows, analyze data, and now build custom Copilots.\\n\\nMore than 230,000 organizations have already used AI capabilities in Power Platform, up over 80% quarter over quarter, and with Copilot Studio, organizations can tailor Copilot for Microsoft 365 or create their own custom Copilots. It is already being used by over 10,000 organizations, including An Post, Holland America, PG&E. In just weeks, for example, both PayPal and Tata Digital built copilots to answer common employee queries, increasing productivity and reducing support costs. We're also using this AI moment to redefine our role in Business Applications, Dynamics 365 once again took share as organizations use our AI-powered apps to transform their marketing, sales, service, finance, and supply chain functions.\\n\\nAnd we are expanding our TAM by integrating Copilot into third-party systems too. In sales out Copilot has helped sellers at more than 30,000 organizations, including Lumen Technologies and Schneider Electric, to enrich their customer interactions using data from Dynamics 365 or Salesforce. And with our new Copilot for service employees at companies like Northern Trust can resolve client queries faster. It includes out-of-the-box integrations to apps like Salesforce, ServiceNow, and VenDesk.\\n\\nWith our industry and cross-industry clouds, we're tailoring our solutions to meet the needs of specific industries. In healthcare, DAX Copilot is being used by more than 100 healthcare systems, including Lifespan, UNC Health, and UPMC, to increase physician productivity and reduce burnout. And our cloud for retail was front and center at NRF with retailers from Canadian Tire Corporation to Leatherman and Ralph Lauren sharing how they will use our solutions across the shopper journey to accelerate time to value. Now on to future of work.\\n\\nA growing body of evidence makes clear the role AI will play in transforming work. Our own research, as well as external studies, show as much as 70% improvement in productivity, using generative AI for specific work tasks, and overall early Copilot for Microsoft 365 users were 29% faster in the series of tasks, like searching, writing, and summarizing. Two months in, we have seen faster adoption than either our E3 or E5 suites as enterprises, like Dentsu, Honda, Pfizer, all deploy Copilot to their employees, and we are expanding availability to organizations of all sizes. We're also seeing a Copilot ecosystem begin to emerge ISVs like Atlassian, Mural, and Trello, as well as customers like Air India, Bayer, and Siemens have all built plug-ins for specific lines of business that extend Copilot's capabilities.\\n\\nWhen it comes to Teams, we again saw record usage as organizations brought together collaboration chat, meetings, and calling on one platform and Teams has also become a new entry point for us. More than two-thirds of our enterprise Teams customers by phone rooms are premium. All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365. We now have more than 400 million paid Office 365 seats and organizations like BP, Elanco, ING Bank, Mediaset, WTW, all chose E5 this quarter to empower their employees with our best-in-class productivity apps, along with advanced security compliance, voice, and analytics.\\n\\nNow on to Windows. In 2024, AI will become a first-class part of every PC. Windows PCs with built-in neural processing units were front and center at CES, unlocking new AI experiences to make what you do on your PC easier and faster from searching for answers and summarizing emails to optimizing performance and battery efficiency. Copilot in Windows is already available on more than 75 million Windows 10 and Windows 11 PCs and with our new Copilot key, the first significant change to the Windows keyboard in 30 years, we're providing one-click access.\\n\\nWe also continue to transform how Windows is experienced and managed with Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365, introducing new features that make it simpler for employees to access and IT teams to secure their cloud PCs. Usage of cloud-delivered Windows increased over 50% year over year. And all up, Windows 11 commercial deployments increased two times year over year as companies like HPE and Petrobras rolled out operating systems to employees. Now onto security.\\n\\nThe recent security attacks, including the nation-state attack on our corporate systems we reported a week and a half ago, have highlighted the urgent need for organizations to move even faster to protect themselves from cyber threats. It's why, last fall, we announced a set of engineering priorities under our secure future initiative, bringing together every part of the company to advance cybersecurity protection across both new products and legacy infrastructure. And it's why we continue to innovate across our security portfolio, as well as our operational security posture, to help customers adopt a zero-trust security architecture. Our industry-first unified security operations platform brings together our SIM Microsoft Sentinel, our XDR Microsoft Defender, and Copilot for security to help teams manage an increasingly complex security landscape.\\n\\nAnd with Copilot for security, we're now helping hundreds of early access customers, including Cmax, Dow, LTI Mindtree, McAfee, Nucor Steel, significantly increase their SecOps team's productivity. This quarter, we extended Copilot to Entra, Intune, and Purview. All-up, we have over 1 million customers, including more than 700,000 who use four or more of our security products like Arrow Electronics, DXC Technology, Freeport-McMoRan, Insight Enterprises, JB Hunt, and the Mosaic Company. Now on to LinkedIn.\\n\\nLinkedIn is now helping over 1 billion members learn, sell, and get hired. We continue to see strong global membership growth driven by member signups in key markets like Germany and India. In an ever-changing job market, members are staying competitive through skill-building and knowledge-sharing. Over the last 12 months, members have added 680 million skills to their profiles, up 80% year over year.\\n\\nOur new AI-powered features are transforming the LinkedIn member experience, everything from how people learn new skills to how they search for jobs, and engage with posts. New AI features, including more personalized emails, also continue to increase business ROI on the platform and our hiring business took share for the sixth consecutive quarter. And more broadly, AI is transforming our search and browser experience. We are encouraged by the momentum, earlier this month, we achieved a new milestone with 5 billion images created and 5 billion chats conducted to date, both doubling quarter over quarter and both being an edge took share this quarter.\\n\\nWe also introduced Copilot as a stand-alone destination across all browsers and devices, as well as a Copilot app on iOS and Android. And just two weeks ago, we introduced Copilot Pro, providing access to the latest models for quick answers and high-quality image creation and access to Copilot for Microsoft 365 personal and family subscribers. Now on to gaming. This quarter we set all-time records for monthly active users in Xbox PC, as well as mobile, where we now have over 200 million monthly active users alone, inclusive of Activision Blizzard King.\\n\\nWith our acquisition, we have added hundreds of millions of gamers to our ecosystem as we execute on our ambition to reach more gamers on more platforms. With cloud gaming, we continue to innovate to offer players more ways to experience the games they love where and when and how they want. Hours streamed increased 44% year over year. Great content is key to our growth and across our portfolio.\\n\\nI've never been more excited about our lineup of upcoming games. Earlier this month, we shared exciting new first-party titles coming this year to Xbox PC and Game Pass, including Indiana Jones, and we've also announced launching significant updates this calendar year to many of our most durable franchises which brings in millions of players each month, including Call of Duty, Elder Scrolls Online, and Starfield. In closing, we are looking forward to how AI-driven transformation will benefit people and organizations in 2024. With that, I'll hand it over to Amy.\\n\\nAmy Hood -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $62 billion, up 18% and 16% in constant currency. When adjusted for the prior year's Q2 charge, operating income increased 25% and 23% in constant currency, and earnings per share was $2.93, which increased 26% and 23% in constant currency. Results exceeded expectations and we delivered another quarter of double-digit top and bottom-line growth.\\n\\nStrong execution by our sales teams and partners drove share gains again this quarter across many of our businesses, as Satya referenced. In our commercial business, strong demand for our Microsoft cloud offerings, including AI services, drove better-than-expected growth and large long-term Azure contracts. Microsoft 365 suite strength contributed to ARPU expansion for our office commercial business, while new business growth continued to be moderated for stand-alone products sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite. Commercial bookings were ahead of expectations and increased 17% and 9% in constant currency on a low expiry base.\\n\\nThe strength in long-term Azure contracts mentioned earlier, along with strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, including healthy renewals drove our results. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 17% and 16% in constant currency to $222 billion, roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 15% year over year. The remaining portion recognized beyond the next 12 months increased 19%. And this quarter, our annuity mix was 96%.\\n\\nIn our consumer business, the PC and advertising markets were generally in line with our expectations. PC market volumes continued to stabilize at pre-pandemic levels. I mean, the gaming console market was a bit smaller. As a reminder, my Q2 commentary includes the net impact of Activision from the date of acquisition, inclusive of purchase accounting, integration, and transaction-related expenses.\\n\\nThe net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first party. At a company level, Activision contributed approximately 4 points to revenue growth, was a 2-point drag on adjusted operating income growth, and a negative $0.5 impact to earnings per share. This impact includes $1.1 billion from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related costs, such as severance-related charges related to last week's announcement. FX was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment-level revenue, COGS, and operating expense growth.\\n\\nMicrosoft Cloud revenue was $33.7 billion, ahead of expectations, and grew 24% and 22% in constant currency. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was 72%, relatively unchanged year over year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, driven by improvement in Azure and Office 365, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. Company gross margin dollars increased 20% and 18% in constant-currency and gross margin percentage increased year over year to 68%.\\n\\nExcluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points, even with the impact of $581 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Growth was driven by improvement in devices, as well as the improvement in Azure and Office 365 as just mentioned. Operating expenses increased 3% with 11 points from the Activision acquisition, partially offset by 7 points of favorable impact from the prior-year Q2 charge. The Activision impact includes $550 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related cost.\\n\\nAt a company level, headcount at the end of December was 2% lower than a year ago. Operating margins increased roughly 5 points year over year to 44%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased roughly 6 points driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier, the favorable impact from the prior-year Q2 charge, and improved operating leverage through disciplined cost control. Now, to our segment results.\\n\\nRevenue from productivity and business processes was $19.2 billion and grew 13% and 12% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by better-than-expected results in LinkedIn. Office commercial revenue grew 15% and 13% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 17% and 16% in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by healthy renewal execution and ARPU growth from continued E5 momentum. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 9% year over year to over $400 million with installed base expansion across all customer segments.\\n\\nSeat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, offset by the continued growth trends in new stand-alone business noted earlier. Office commercial licensing declined 17% and 18% in constant currency with continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Office consumer revenue increased 5% and 4% in constant currency with continued momentum in Microsoft 355 subscriptions, which grew 16% to 78.4 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 9% and 8% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better-than-expected performance across all businesses.\\n\\nIn our Talent Solutions business bookings growth was again impacted by weaker hiring environment in key verticals. Dynamics revenue grew 21% and 19% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 27% and 24% in constant currency with continued growth across all workloads. Bookings growth was impacted by weaker new business, primarily in Dynamics 365 ERP and CRM workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 14% and 12% in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased slightly year over year.\\n\\nExcluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, primarily driven by improvement in Office 365. Operating expenses decreased 5% and 6% in constant currency with 5 points of favorable impact from the prior-year Q2 charge. Operating income increased 26% and 24% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment revenue was $25.9 billion, increasing 20% and 19% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, with better-than-expected results across all businesses.\\n\\nOverall server products and cloud services revenue grew 22% and 20% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 30% and 28% in constant currency, including 6 points of growth from AI services. Both AI and non-AI Azure services drove our outperformance. In our per-user business, the Enterprise Mobility and Security installed base grew 11% to over 268 million seats with continued impact from the growth trends in new stand-alone business noted earlier.\\n\\nIn our on-premises server business, revenue increased 3% and 2% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven primarily by the better-than-expected demand related to Windows Server 2012 end of support. Enterprise and partner services revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency with better-than-expected performance across enterprise support services and industry solutions. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 18% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, driven by the improvement in Azure noted earlier, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand.\\n\\nOperating expenses decreased 8% and 9% in constant currency with 9 points of favorable impact from the prior-year Q2 charge. Operating income grew 40% and 37% in constant currency. Now to more personal computing. Revenue was $16.9 billion, increasing 19% and 18% in constant currency, in line with expectations overall.\\n\\nGrowth includes 15 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Windows OEM revenue increased 11% year over year, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better performance and higher monetizing consumer markets. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 9% and 7% in constant currency, below expectations primarily [Technical difficulty] period revenue recognition from the mix of contracts. Annuity billings growth remains healthy.\\n\\nDevices revenue decreased 9% and 10% in constant currency, ahead of expectations due to stronger execution in the commercial segment. Search and news advertising revenue, ex TAC, increased 8% and 7% in constant currency, relatively in line with expectations, driven by higher search volume, offset by negative impact from a third-party partnership. And in gaming, revenue increased 49% and 48% in constant currency, with 44 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Total gaming revenue was in line with expectations of stronger-than-expected performance from Activision was offset by the weaker-than-expected console market noted earlier.\\n\\nXbox content and services revenue increased 61% and 60% in constant currency, driven by 55 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Xbox hardware revenue grew 3% and 1% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 34% and 32% in constant currency with 17 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Gross margin percentage increased roughly 6 points year over year, driven by higher devices gross margin and sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses.\\n\\nOperating expenses increased 38% with 48 points of impact from the Activision acquisition, partially offset by 6 points of favorable impact from the prior-year Q2 charge. Operating income increased 29% and 26% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $11.5 billion, lower-than-expected due to delivery for a third-party capacity contract shifting from Q2 to Q3.\\n\\nCash paid for PP&E was $9.7 billion. These data center investments support our cloud demand, inclusive of needs to scale our AI infrastructure. Cash flow from operations was $18.9 billion, up 69% driven by strong cloud billings and collections on a prior-year comparable that was impacted by lower operating income. Free cash flow was $9.1 billion, up 86% year over year, reflecting the timing of cash paid for property and equipment.\\n\\nThis quarter, other income and expense was in line with expectations, negative $506 million, driven by interest expense and net losses on investments, partially offset by interest income. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%. And finally, we returned $8.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now moving to our Q3 outlook, which, unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S.\\n\\ndollar basis. First, FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue and segment-level revenue growth by less than 1 point. And we expect no impact to COGS and operating expense growth.\\n\\nIn commercial bookings, strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, including healthy renewals, along with long-term Azure commitments should drive healthy growth on a growing expiry base. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should decrease roughly 1 point year over year, excluding the impact from the accounting estimate change, Q3 cloud gross margin percentage will be relatively flat as improvement in Office 365 and Azure will be offset by sales mix shift to Azure, as well as the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase materially on a sequential basis, driven by investments in our cloud and AI infrastructure and the flip of a delivery date from Q2 to Q3 from a third-party provider noted earlier. As a reminder, there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-out.\\n\\nNext to segment guidance. In productivity and business processes, we expect revenue of $19.3 billion to $19.6 billion or growth between 10% and 12%. In Office commercial revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be approximately 15% in constant currency.\\n\\nWhile it's early days for Microsoft 365 Copilot, we're excited by the adoption we've seen to date and continue to expect revenue to grow over time. In our on-premise business, we expect revenue to decline in the low 20s. In Office consumer, we expect revenue growth in the mid-to-high single-digits, driven by Microsoft's 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid-to-high single digits, driven by continued growth across all businesses.\\n\\nAnd in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the mid-teens, driven by Dynamics 365. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue of $26 billion to $26.3 billion or growth between 18% and 19%. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability, primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q3 revenue growth in constant currency to remain stable to our stronger-than-expected Q2 results.\\n\\nGrowth will be driven by our Azure consumption business with continued strong contribution from AI. Our per-user business should see benefit from Microsoft 365 Suite momentum though we expect continued moderation in seat growth rates given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth in the low-to-mid single-digits with continued hybrid demand, including licenses running in multi-cloud environments. And in the enterprise and partner services revenue should decline approximately 10% on a high prior-year comparable for enterprise support services and more personal computing, we expect revenue of $14.7 billion, $15.1 billion, or growth between 11% and 14%.\\n\\nWindows OEM revenue growth should be relatively flat as PC market unit volumes continue at pre-pandemic levels. In Windows commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our Advanced Security Solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid-teens. As a reminder, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability, primarily from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts. In Devices, revenue should decline in the low-double-digits as we continue to focus on our higher-margin premium products.\\n\\nSearch and news advertising, ex TAC, revenue growth should be in the mid-to-high single-digits, about 8 points higher than overall search and news advertising revenue, driven by continued volume strength. And in gaming, we expect revenue growth in the low 40s, including approximately 45 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the low-to-mid 50s, driven by approximately 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Hardware revenue will decline year over year.\\n\\nNow back to company guidance. We expect COGS between $18.6 billion to $18.8 billion, including approximately $700 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets from the Activision acquisition. We expect operating expenses of $15.8 billion to $15.9 billion, including approximately $300 million from purchase accounting, integration, and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Other income and expenses should be roughly negative $600 million as interest income will be more than offset by interest expense and other losses.\\n\\nAs a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be in line with our full-year rate, which we now expect to be approximately 18%. Now, some additional thoughts on the full fiscal year. First, FX, assuming current rates remain stable, we now expect FX to increase Q4 and full-year revenue growth by less than 1 point.\\n\\nWe continue to expect no meaningful impact to full-year COGS or operating expense growth. Second, Activision. For the full-year FY 2024, we expect Activision to be accretive to operating income when excluding purchase accounting, integration, and transaction-related costs. At a total company level, we delivered strong results in H1, and demand for our Microsoft Cloud continues to drive the growth in our outlook for H2.\\n\\nOur commitment to scaling our cloud and AI investment is guided by customer demand and a substantial market opportunity. As we scale these investments, we remain focused on driving efficiencies across every layer of our tech stack and disciplined cost management across every team. Therefore, we expect full-year operating margins to be up 1 to 2 points year over year, even as AI capital investments drive COGS growth. This operating margin expansion excludes the impact from the Activision acquisition and the headwind from the change in useful lives last year.\\n\\nIn closing, we are focused on execution, so our customers can realize the benefits of AI productivity gains as we invest to lead this AI platform wave. With that, let's go to Q&A, Brett.\\n\\nBrett Iversen -- General Manager, Investor Relations\\n\\nThanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. [Operator instructions] Joe, can you please repeat your instructions?\\n\\nQuestions & Answers:\\n\\nOperator\\n\\n[Operator instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.\\n\\nMark Moerdler -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst\\n\\nThank you very much. Congratulations on the strong quarter and thanks for letting me ask the question. Amy, you've discussed Azure being stable and you deliver Azure growth stability, but if we drill in one layer, we see Azure AI continuing to become a bigger portion of the revenue. I understand that separating what is directly AI revenue versus other IaaS, PaaS revenue that are leveraging well driven by AI is difficult, can you help me with two related questions? Optimization has been stabilizing and at some point, it should be part of the revenue flow.\\n\\nHow should we think about what happens then, do we see non-directly AI consumption being flattish or do we see a rebound as the cloud shift continues and the need for data of inferencing grows? Second point, on AI, where are we in the journey from training driving most of Azure AI usage to inferencing? When do you think we start to see pickup in non-Microsoft inferencing kick in, when do you think we could hit the point where inferencing is the bigger part of the driver? Thank you.\\n\\nSatya Nadella -- Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYou want me to go first and --\\n\\nAmy Hood -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYou go first, and I'll take the technical.\\n\\nSatya Nadella -- Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYes, let me -- just on the inferencing and training, most of what you've seen for the most part is all inferencing. So none of the large model training stuff is in any of our higher numbers at all. What small batch training, so somebody is doing fine-tuning or what have you, that will be there, but that's sort of a minor part. So most of what you see in the Azure number is broadly inferencing.\\n\\nAnd Mark, I think it may be helpful to sort of think about, like what is the new workload in AI? The new workload in AI, obviously, in our case starts with one of the frontier -- I mean, starts with the Frontier model Azure OpenAI. But it's not just about just one model, right? So you first -- you take that model. You do RLHF. You may do some fine-tuning.\\n\\nYou do retrieval, which means you are sort of either heating some storage meter or you're heating some compute meters. And so to -- and by the way, you will also distill a large model to a small model, and that would be a training perhaps. But that's a small batch training that uses essentially inference infrastructure. So I think that's what's happening.\\n\\nSo you could even say these AI workloads themselves will have a lifecycle which is they'll get rebuilt, then there'll be continuously optimized over time. So that's sort of one side. And I think if I understand your question, what's happening with the traditional optimization, and I think last quarter we said. One, we're going to continue to have these cycles where people will build new workloads, they will optimize the workloads and then they'll start new workloads.\\n\\nSo I think that that's what we continue to see, but that period of massive, I'll call it, optimization only and no new workloads start, that I think has ended at this point. So what you're seeing is much more of that continuous cycle by customers, both whether it comes to AI or whether it comes to the traditional workloads.\\n\\nAmy Hood -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nNo, maybe I'll just add just a few things there. I think whether you use the word lapping, these optimization comparables, or the comparables easing is all sort of the same thing, that we're getting to that point in H2. That's absolutely true. We'd like to talk about the contribution of AI, specifically for the reason Satya talked about, these are -- this is starting to see the application of AI at scale.\\n\\nAnd we want to be able to show people this is how that point will work. It's inferencing workloads where people are expecting productivity gains, other benefits that grow revenue. And so I do think about those as those related. And ultimately, the TAM we go after is best sort of across both of those, both AI workload and I guess non-AI workload.\\n\\nAlthough, to Satya's point, you need all of it.\\n\\nMark Moerdler -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst\\n\\nPerfect. Thank you very much for the deep answer.\\n\\nBrett Iversen -- General Manager, Investor Relations\\n\\nThanks, Mark. Joe, next question, please.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed.\\n\\nBrent Thill -- Jefferies -- Analyst\\n\\nGood afternoon. Amy, the margin improvement is pretty shocking the most considering the investments that you and Satya are putting in AI. I'm curious if you could just walk through, how this is possible and what you're seeing so far in some of the costs that you're trying to manage as you scale up AI.\\n\\nAmy Hood -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThanks, Brent. First of all, thanks for the question. The teams are obviously been hard at work on this topic. We do point out that in Q2 because of the impact of the charge a year ago, you're seeing larger margin improvement than I would say sort of a run-rate margin improvement.\\n\\nSo let me first say that. Secondly, the absolute margin improvement has also been very good and it speaks to, I think one of the things Satya talked about and I reiterated a bit, which is that we really to make sure we're making investments, we're making them and consistently across the tech stack. The tech stack we're building, no matter what team is on is inclusive of AI enablement. And so think about as building that consistency without needing to add a lot of resources to do that.\\n\\nIt's been a real pivot of our entire investment infrastructure to be working on this work and I think that's important because it means you're shifting to an AI-first position, not just in the language we use but in what people are working on day-to-day, that does obviously create leverage opportunity. There has also been really good work put in by many teams on improving the gross margin of the products, we talked about it was Office 365, we talked about in Azure core. We even talked about it across our devices portfolio, where we've seen material improvements over the course of the year. And so when you kind of take improvements at the gross margin level, plus this consistency of repivoting our workforce toward the AI-first work we're doing without adding material number of people to the workforce, you end up with that type of leverage.\\n\\nAnd we still need to be investing. And so the important part, invest toward the thing that's going to shape the next decade and continue to stay focused on being able to deliver your day-to-day commitments. And so it's a great question. And hopefully, that helps piece apart a few of the components.\\n\\nBrent Thill -- Jefferies -- Analyst\\n\\nThanks, Amy.\\n\\nBrett Iversen -- General Manager, Investor Relations\\n\\nThanks, Brent. Joe, next question, please.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\\n\\nKash Rangan -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\n\\nHi. Thank you very much. A superb quarter of great improvements. One -- just one question for you, Satya.\\n\\nCloud computing changed the tech stack in ways that we could not imagine 10 years back, the nature of the database layer or the operating system layer, every layer just changed dramatically. How do you foresee generative AI changing the tech stack as we know it? Thank you so much.\\n\\nSatya Nadella -- Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. I think it's going to have a very foundational impact. In fact, you can say the core compute architecture itself changes, everything from power, power density to the data center design, to what used to be the accelerator, now is the sort of the main CPU, so to speak, or the main compute unit. And so I think in the network, the memory architecture, all of it, so as the core computer architecture changes, I think every workload changes.\\n\\nAnd so yes, so there is a full, like, take our data layer, the most exciting thing for me in the last year has been to see how our data layer has evolved to be built for AI, right? If you think about Fabric, one of the genius of Fabric is to be able to say, let's separate out storage from the compute layer, in compute we'll have traditional sequels that have Spark, and by the way, you can have an Azure AI job on-top of the same data lake, so to speak, or the lake house pattern. And then the business model you can combine all of those different compute. So that's the type of compute architecture. So it's sort of a -- so that's just one example.\\n\\nThe tool stuff is changing. Office, I mean, if you think about what -- if I look at Copilot; Copilot's extensibility with GPT, Copilot apps to the Copilot stack, that's another sort of part of what's happening to the tech stack. So yes, I mean, definitely builds. I mean.\\n\\nI do believe, being in the cloud has been very helpful to build AI, but now, AI is just redefining what it means to have, what the cloud looks like, both at the infrastructure level and the app model.\\n\\nKash Rangan -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\n\\nTerrific. Thank you so much.\\n\\nBrett Iversen -- General Manager, Investor Relations\\n\\nThanks, Kash. Joe, our next question, please.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed.\\n\\nKarl Keirstead -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nThank you. I wanted to return to AI, the 6-point AI lift to Azure is just extraordinary, but I wanted to ask you about your progress in standing up the infrastructure to meet that demand. If you feel like Microsoft is supply GPU-constrained. Is the success you've had maybe working through some of the scaling bottlenecks that some of the other cloud infrastructure providers have talked about, a little bit maybe on the infrastructure scaling front might be interesting.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nAmy Hood -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThanks, Karl. Maybe I'll start and Satya feel free to add on. I think we feel really good about where we have been in terms of adding capacity. You started to see the acceleration in our capital expense starting almost a year ago, and you've seen us scale through that process.\\n\\nAnd that is going toward as we talked about Servers and also new data center footprints to be able to meet what we see as this demand and really changing demand as we look forward. And so I do feel like the team has done a very good job. I feel like, primarily obviously, this is being built by us, but we've also used third-party capacity to help when we could have that help us in terms of meeting customer demand. And I think looking forward, you'll tend to C&I guide toward it, accelerated capital expense to continue to be able to add capacity in the coming quarters, given what we see in terms of pipeline.\\n\\nBrett Iversen -- General Manager, Investor Relations\\n\\nThanks, Karl. Joe, next question, please.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\\n\\nBrad Zelnick -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thank you so much for taking the question. The early market feedback that we're all hearing on Microsoft 365 Copilot is very powerful. Can you provide more granularity on what you're seeing in terms of adoption trends versus perhaps other new product introductions in the past, what if anything is holding it back, and how much of a priority is it to get it in the hands of customers? To what lengths might you go to incentivize just getting it out in the market? Thank you.\\n\\nSatya Nadella -- Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nNo, thank you for the question, Brad. So a couple of things. In my comments I said increase in relation to our previous suites like, let's say, E3 or E5. Whatever two months in, it's definitely much faster than that.\\n\\nAnd so from that perspective, it's exciting to see, I'd say, the demand signal, the deployment signal. I was looking at by tenant, even usage, it's faster than anything else because it's easier, right? I mean, it's sort of -- it shows up in your app, if you click on it, like any ribbon thing, and it becomes a daily habit. So it in fact, it reminds me a little bit of sort of the back in the day of PC adoption, right? It's kind of -- I think it first starts off with few people having access. There are many companies that are doing standard issue, right? So just like PCs became standard issue at some point after PCs being adopted by early adopters.\\n\\nI think that's the cycle that at least we expect. In terms of what we're seeing, it's actually interesting, if you look at the data we have, summarization, that's what it's like, number one. Like I'm doing summarization of Teams meetings inside of Teams, during the meeting, after the meeting, Word documents summarization, I get something in email on summarizing. So summarization has become a big deal.\\n\\nDrafts, right, you're drafting emails, drafting documents. So anytime you want to start something, the blank page thing goes away and you start by prompting and drafting. Chat, to me, the most powerful feature is now you have the most important database in your company, which happens to be the database of your documents and communications. It is now queryable by natural language in a powerful way, right? I can go and say, what are all the things Amy said I should be watching out for next quarter, and it will come out with great detail.\\n\\nAnd so Chat, summarization, draft, and also, by the way, actions. One of the most used thing is here's the Word document, go complete, I mean, create a PowerPoint for me. So those are the stuff that is also beginning. So I feel like these all become -- but fundamentally, what happens is, if you remember the PC adoption cycle, what it did was work artifact and workflow changed, right? You can imagine what forecasting was before Excel and email and what it was after.\\n\\nSo similarly, you'll see work and workflow change as people summarize faster, draft regulatory submissions faster, chat to get knowledge from your business. And so those are the things that we are seeing as overall patterns.\\n\\nAmy Hood -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nAnd maybe just to add two points. One of the exciting things, as I said, for some companies, it's going to be standard issue like PC. For other companies, they may want to do a land with a smaller group, see the productivity gains, and then expand. And so being able to lift some of the seat requirements that we did earlier this month, it's really going to allow customers to be able to use that approach, too.\\n\\nAnd the other thing I would add, we always talk about in enterprise software. You sell software, then you wait, and then it gets deployed. And then after deployment, you want to see usage. And in particular, what we've seen and you would expect this, in some ways with Copilot.\\n\\nEven in the early stages, obviously, deployment happens very quickly. But really, what we're seeing is engagement grow. As to Satya's point on how you learn and your behavior changes, you see engagement grow with time. And so I think those are just to put a pin in that because it's an important dynamic when we think about the optimism you hear from us.\\n\\nBrad Zelnick -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\\n\\nExcellent. Thank you so much.\\n\\nBrett Iversen -- General Manager, Investor Relations\\n\\nThanks, Brad. Joe, next question, please.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.\\n\\nMark Murphy -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\\n\\nYeah. Thank you very much. Is it possible to unpack the 6-point AI services tailwind, just to help us understand which elements ramped up by the 3 incremental points? For instance, is it more of the OpenAI inferencing, GitHub Copilot, other copilots, the Azure OpenAI service, third-party LLMs running on Azure? I'm just wondering, where did you see the strongest step up in that activity?\\n\\nAmy Hood -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nMark, without getting into tons of line items, it's more simple to think of it as, really, it's people adopting it for inferencing at the API generally. I mean, that's the easiest way to think about it. And we also saw growth in GitHub Copilot which you talked -- which Satya talked about, and we saw a growing number of third parties using it in some small ways for training. But this is primarily an inferencing workload right now in terms of what's driving that number.\\n\\nWe used to think of it that way.\\n\\nSatya Nadella -- Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAzure OpenAI and then OpenAIs on APIs on top of Azure would be the sort of the major drivers, but there is a lot of the small batch training that goes on, whether it's a graph or fine-tuning, and then lot of people who are starting to use models as a service with all the other new models, but it's predominantly Azure OpenAI today.\\n\\nMark Murphy -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nBrett Iversen -- General Manager, Investor Relations\\n\\nThanks, Mark. Joe, next question, please.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed.\\n\\nBrad Reback -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thanks very much. Amy, for many, many years in commercial Office 365 seat growth has far outpaced ARPU and over the last couple of quarters, we're getting a convergence, obviously, as the seat count gets really large. As we look forward, should they run even for a period of time? Or should we expect ARPU to outpace seat growth here in the short term? Thanks.\\n\\nAmy Hood -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThat's a great question, Brad. Let me split apart the components. And then we can come back to whether they should equalize or just go on sort of a bit, actually believe it or not, somewhat independent trajectory and I will explain why I say that. Your seat growth as we talk about is primarily from, at this point, small and medium-sized businesses and really frontline workers scenarios.\\n\\nAnd to your point on occasion, those are lower ARPU seats, but there are also -- there are new seats and so you see that in the seat count number. And as we get through and we've seen that come down a little bit quarter over quarter, and we've guided for that really to happen again next quarter. But a very separate thing is being able to add ARPU. And traditionally, and again this quarter, right, that's come over time from E3 then from E5.\\n\\nAnd we're continuing to see very healthy seat momentum, and you heard very good renewals. So all of that, right, completely independent in some way from seat growth. Then the next thing that actually we just talked about, maybe in Brad's question, I'm trying to -- is that you're going to see Copilot revenue will run there as ARPU, right? That won't show a seat growth. So you'll have E3, E5 transition, Copilot all show up in ARPU over time, and then you'll have the seat growth be primarily still small business and frontline worker and maybe new industry scenarios.\\n\\nSo I tend to not really, Brad, think about them as related lines, believe it or not. I think about them as sort of unique independent motions we run, and there is still room for seat growth. And obviously, with the levers we've talked about, there's room for ARPU growth as well.\\n\\nBrad Reback -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\\n\\nThat's great. Thanks very much.\\n\\nBrett Iversen -- General Manager, Investor Relations\\n\\nThanks, Brad. Joe, we have time for one last question.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nOur last question will come from the line of Tyler Radke with Citi. Please proceed.\\n\\nTyler Radke -- Citi -- Analyst\\n\\nThanks for taking my question. Satya, your enthusiasm about GitHub Copilot was noticeable on the conference call and at the AI Summit in New York last week. I'm wondering how you're thinking about pricing. Obviously, this is driving pretty incredible breakthroughs and productivity for developers.\\n\\nBut how do you think about your ability to drive ARPU on the GitHub Copilot over time? And just talk us through how you're thinking about the next phase of new releases there.\\n\\nSatya Nadella -- Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYeah. I mean -- it's -- I always go back to sort of my own conviction that this generation of AI is going to be different, started with the move from 2.5 to 3 of GPT and then its use inside of developer scenario with GitHub Copilot. And so yes, I think this is the place where it's most evolved. In terms of its economic benefits or productivity benefits, and you see it.\\n\\nWe see it inside of Microsoft. We see it in all of the key studies we put out of customers. Everybody had talked to its pickup, but it is the one place where it's becoming standard issue for any developer is like if you take away spellcheck from Word, I'll be unemployable. And similarly, it will be like -- I think GitHub Copilot becomes core to anybody who is doing software development.\\n\\nThe thing that you brought up is a little bit of a continuation to how Amy talked about, right, so you are going to start seeing people think of these tools as productivity enhancers, right? I mean, if I look at it, our ARPUs have been great, but they're pretty low. Even though we've had a lot of success, it's not like we had a high-priced ARPU company. I think what you're going to start finding is, whether it's Sales Copilot or Service Copilot or GitHub Copilot or Security Copilot, they are going to fundamentally capture some of the value they drive in terms of the productivity of the opex, right? So it's like 2 points, 3 points of opex leverage would be goal is on software spend. I think that's a pretty straightforward value equation.\\n\\nAnd so that's the first time, I mean, this is not something we've been able to make the case for before whereas now I think we have that case. Then even the horizontal copilot is what Amy was talking about, which is at the Office 365 or Microsoft 365 level, even there, you can make the same argument whatever ARPU we may even have with E5, now, you can see incrementally as a percentage of the opex, how much would you pay for a copilot to give you more time savings for example. And so yes, I think all up, I do see this as a new vector for us in what I'll call the next phase of knowledge work and frontline work, even in their productivity and how we participate. And I think GitHub Copilot, I never thought of the tools business as fundamentally participating in the operating expenses of a company's spend on, let's say, development activity and now you're seeing that transition.\\n\\nIt is just not tools. It's about productivity of your dev team.\\n\\nBrett Iversen -- General Manager, Investor Relations\\n\\nThanks, Tyler. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.\\n\\nAmy Hood -- Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nSatya Nadella -- Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\n[Operator signoff]\", metadata={'source': 'MSFT_q2_2024.txt'})]\n",

Subscribe to our free eBooks blog \\nand email newsletter.The Metamorphosis\\nBy Franz Kafka (1915)\\n\\n\\nThe Metamorphosis \\x18This text is a translation from the German by Ian Johnston, \\nMalaspina University-College Nanaimo, BC. It has been \\nprepared for students in the Liberal Studies and English \\ndepartments. This document is in the public domain, \\nreleased, January 1999 \\n\\n\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.comI\\nOne morning, as Gregor Samsa was waking up from \\nanxious dreams, he discovered that in bed he had been \\nchanged into a monstrous verminous bug. He lay on his ar -\\nmour-hard back and saw, as he lifted his head up a little, his \\nbrown, arched abdomen divided up into rigid bow-like sec -\\ntions. From this height the blanket, just about ready to slide \\noff completely, could hardly stay in place. His numerous \\nlegs, pitifully thin in comparison to the rest of his circum -\\nference, flickered helplessly before his eyes.\\n‘What’s happened to me,’ he thought. It was no dream. \\nHis room, a proper room for a human being, only some -\\nwhat too small, lay quietly between the four well-known \\nwalls. Above the table, on which an unpacked collection of \\nsample cloth goods was spread out (Samsa was a traveling \\nsalesman) hung the picture which he had cut out of an il -\\nlustrated magazine a little while ago and set in a pretty gilt \\nframe. It was a picture of a woman with a fur hat and a fur \\nboa. She sat erect there, lifting up in the direction of the \\nviewer a solid fur muff into which her entire forearm dis -\\nappeared.\\nGregor’s glance then turned to the window. The dreary \\nweather (the rain drops were falling audibly down on the \\nmetal window ledge) made him quite melancholy. ‘Why \\ndon’t I keep sleeping for a little while longer and forget all \\n\\nThe Metamorphosis \\x18this foolishness,’ he thought. But this was entirely impracti -\\ncal, for he was used to sleeping on his right side, and in his \\npresent state he couldn’t get himself into this position. No \\nmatter how hard he threw himself onto his right side, he \\nalways rolled again onto his back. He must have tried it a \\nhundred times, closing his eyes, so that he would not have \\nto see the wriggling legs, and gave up only when he began \\nto feel a light, dull pain in his side which he had never felt \\nbefore.\\n‘O God,’ he thought, ‘what a demanding job I’ve chosen! \\nDay in, day out on the road. The stresses of trade are much \\ngreater than the work going on at head office, and, in addi -\\ntion to that, I have to deal with the problems of traveling, \\nthe worries about train connections, irregular bad food, \\ntemporary and constantly changing human relationships \\nwhich never come from the heart. To hell with it all!’ He felt \\na slight itching on the top of his abdomen. He slowly pushed \\nhimself on his back closer to the bed post so that he could \\nlift his head more easily, found the itchy part, which was \\nentirely covered with small white spots (he did not know \\nwhat to make of them), and wanted to feel the place with a \\nleg. But he retracted it immediately, for the contact felt like \\na cold shower all over him.\\nHe slid back again into his earlier position. ‘This getting \\nup early,’ he thought, ‘makes a man quite idiotic. A man \\nmust have his sleep. Other traveling salesmen live like ha -\\nrem women. For instance, when I come back to the inn \\nduring the course of the morning to write up the necessary \\norders, these gentlemen are just sitting down to breakfast. \\n\\n\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.comIf I were to try that with my boss, I’d be thrown out on the \\nspot. Still, who knows whether that mightn’t be really good \\nfor me. If I didn’t hold back for my parents’ sake, I would’ve \\nquit ages ago. I would’ve gone to the boss and told him just \\nwhat I think from the bottom of my heart. He would’ve fall -\\nen right off his desk! How weird it is to sit up at the desk and \\ntalk down to the employee from way up there. The boss has \\ntrouble hearing, so the employee has to step up quite close \\nto him. Anyway, I haven’t completely given up that hope \\nyet. Once I’ve got together the money to pay off the parents’ \\ndebt to him—that should take another five or six years—I’ll \\ndo it for sure. Then I’ll make the big break. In any case, right \\nnow I have to get up. My train leaves at five o’clock.’\\nAnd he looked over at the alarm clock ticking away by \\nthe chest of drawers. ‘Good God,’ he thought. It was half \\npast six, and the hands were going quietly on. It was past \\nthe half hour, already nearly quarter to. Could the alarm \\nhave failed to ring? One saw from the bed that it was prop -\\nerly set for four o’clock. Certainly it had rung. Yes, but was it \\npossible to sleep through this noise that made the furniture \\nshake? Now, it’s true he’d not slept quietly, but evident -\\nly he’d slept all the more deeply. Still, what should he do \\nnow? The next train left at seven o’clock. To catch that one, \\nhe would have to go in a mad rush. The sample collection \\nwasn’t packed up yet, and he really didn’t feel particular -\\nly fresh and active. And even if he caught the train, there \\nwas no avoiding a blow up with the boss, because the firm’s \\nerrand boy would’ve waited for the five o’clock train and re -\\nported the news of his absence long ago. He was the boss’s \\n\\nThe Metamorphosis \\x18minion, without backbone or intelligence. Well then, what \\nif he reported in sick? But that would be extremely em -\\nbarrassing and suspicious, because during his five years’ \\nservice Gregor hadn’t been sick even once. The boss would \\ncertainly come with the doctor from the health insurance \\ncompany and would reproach his parents for their lazy son \\nand cut short all objections with the insurance doctor’s \\ncomments; for him everyone was completely healthy but re -\\nally lazy about work. And besides, would the doctor in this \\ncase be totally wrong? Apart from a really excessive drowsi -\\nness after the long sleep, Gregor in fact felt quite well and \\neven had a really strong appetite.\\nAs he was thinking all this over in the greatest haste, \\nwithout being able to make the decision to get out of bed \\n(the alarm clock was indicating exactly quarter to seven) \\nthere was a cautious knock on the door by the head of the \\nbed.\\n‘Gregor,’ a voice called (it was his mother!) ‘it’s quar -\\nter to seven. Don’t you want to be on your way?’ The soft  \\nvoice! Gregor was startled when he heard his voice answer -\\ning. It was clearly and unmistakably his earlier voice, but \\nin it was intermingled, as if from below, an irrepressibly \\npainful squeaking which left the words positively distinct \\nonly in the first moment and distorted them in the rever -\\nberation, so that one didn’t know if one had heard correctly. \\nGregor wanted to answer in detail and explain everything, \\nbut in these circumstances he confined himself to saying, \\n‘Yes, yes, thank you mother. I’m getting up right away.’ Be -\\ncause of the wooden door the change in Gregor’s voice was \\n\\n\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.comnot really noticeable outside, so his mother calmed down \\nwith this explanation and shuffled off. However, as a result \\nof the short conversation the other family members be -\\ncame aware of the fact that Gregor was unexpectedly still \\nat home, and already his father was knocking on one side \\ndoor, weakly but with his fist. ‘Gregor, Gregor,’ he called \\nout, ‘what’s going on?’ And after a short while he urged him \\non again in a deeper voice. ‘Gregor!’ Gregor!’ At the other \\nside door, however, his sister knocked lightly. ‘Gregor? Are \\nyou all right? Do you need anything?’ Gregor directed an -\\nswers in both directions, ‘I’ll be ready right away.’ He made \\nan effort with the most careful articulation and by inserting \\nlong pauses between the individual words to remove every -\\nthing remarkable from his voice. His father turned back to \\nhis breakfast. However, the sister whispered, ‘Gregor, open \\nthe door, I beg you.’ Gregor had no intention of opening the \\ndoor, but congratulated himself on his precaution, acquired \\nfrom traveling, of locking all doors during the night, even \\nat home.\\nFirst he wanted to stand up quietly and undisturbed, \\nget dressed, above all have breakfast, and only then con -\\nsider further action, for (he noticed this clearly) by thinking \\nthings over in bed he would not reach a reasonable conclu -\\nsion. He remembered that he had already often felt a light \\npain or other in bed, perhaps the result of an awkward ly -\\ning position, which later turned out to be purely imaginary \\nwhen he stood up, and he was eager to see how his present \\nfantasies would gradually dissipate. That the change in his \\nvoice was nothing other than the onset of a real chill, an \\n\\nThe Metamorphosis \\x18occupational illness of commercial travelers, of that he had \\nnot the slightest doubt.\\nIt was very easy to throw aside the blanket. He needed \\nonly to push himself up a little, and it fell by itself. But to \\ncontinue was difficult, particularly because he was so un -\\nusually wide. He needed arms and hands to push himself \\nupright. Instead of these, however, he had only many small \\nlimbs which were incessantly moving with very different \\nmotions and which, in addition, he was unable to control. \\nIf he wanted to bend one of them, then it was the first to ex -\\ntend itself, and if he finally succeeded doing with this limb \\nwhat he wanted, in the meantime all the others, as if left  \\nfree, moved around in an excessively painful agitation. ‘But \\nI must not stay in bed uselessly,’ said Gregor to himself.\\nAt first he wanted to get of the bed with the lower part \\nof his body, but this lower part (which he incidentally had \\nnot yet looked at and which he also couldn’t picture clearly) \\nproved itself too difficult to move. The attempt went so slow -\\nly. When, having become almost frantic, he finally hurled \\nhimself forward with all his force and without thinking, he \\nchose his direction incorrectly, and he hit the lower bedpost \\nhard. The violent pain he felt revealed to him that the lower \\npart of his body was at the moment probably the most sen -\\nsitive.\\nThus, he tried to get his upper body out of the bed first \\nand turned his head carefully toward the edge of the bed. \\nHe managed to do this easily, and in spite of its width and \\nweight his body mass at last slowly followed the turning of \\nhis head. But as he finally raised his head outside the bed in \\n\\n\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.comthe open air, he became anxious about moving forward any \\nfurther in this manner, for if he allowed himself eventually \\nto fall by this process, it would take a miracle to prevent his \\nhead from getting injured. And at all costs he must not lose \\nconsciousness right now. He preferred to remain in bed.\\nHowever, after a similar effort, while he lay there again \\nsighing as before and once again saw his small limbs fight -\\ning one another, if anything worse than before, and didn’t \\nsee any chance of imposing quiet and order on this arbitrary \\nmovement, he told himself again that he couldn’t possibly \\nremain in bed and that it might be the most reasonable \\nthing to sacrifice everything if there was even the slight -\\nest hope of getting himself out of bed in the process. At the \\nsame moment, however, he didn’t forget to remind himself \\nfrom time to time of the fact that calm (indeed the calmest) \\nreflection might be better than the most confused deci -\\nsions. At such moments, he directed his gaze as precisely as \\nhe could toward the window, but unfortunately there was \\nlittle confident cheer to be had from a glance at the morn -\\ning mist, which concealed even the other side of the narrow \\nstreet. ‘It’s already seven o’clock’ he told himself at the latest \\nstriking of the alarm clock, ‘already seven o’clock and still \\nsuch a fog.’ And for a little while longer he lay quietly with \\nweak breathing, as if perhaps waiting for normal and natu -\\nral conditions to re-emerge out of the complete stillness.\\nBut then he said to himself, ‘Before it strikes a quarter \\npast seven, whatever happens I must be completely out of \\nbed. Besides, by then someone from the office will arrive to \\ninquire about me, because the office will open before sev -\\n\\nThe Metamorphosis 10en o’clock.’ And he made an effort then to rock his entire \\nbody length out of the bed with a uniform motion. If he let \\nhimself fall out of the bed in this way, his head, which in \\nthe course of the fall he intended to lift up sharply, would \\nprobably remain uninjured. His back seemed to be hard; \\nnothing would really happen to that as a result of the fall. \\nHis greatest reservation was a worry about the loud noise \\nwhich the fall must create and which presumably would \\narouse, if not fright, then at least concern on the other side \\nof all the doors. However, it had to be tried.\\nAs Gregor was in the process of lifting himself half out \\nof bed (the new method was more of a game than an effort; \\nhe needed only to rock with a constant rhythm) it struck \\nhim how easy all this would be if someone were to come to \\nhis aid. Two strong people (he thought of his father and the \\nservant girl) would have been quite sufficient. They would \\nhave only had to push their arms under his arched back to \\nget him out of the bed, to bend down with their load, and \\nthen merely to exercise patience and care that he complet -\\ned the flip onto the floor, where his diminutive legs would \\nthen, he hoped, acquire a purpose. Now, quite apart from \\nthe fact that the doors were locked, should he really call out \\nfor help? In spite of all his distress, he was unable to sup -\\npress a smile at this idea.\\nHe had already got to the point where, with a stronger \\nrocking, he maintained his equilibrium with difficulty, and \\nvery soon he would finally have to decide, for in five minutes \\nit would be a quarter past seven. Then there was a ring at the \\ndoor of the apartment. ‘That’s someone from the office’ he \\n\\n11 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.comtold himself, and he almost froze while his small limbs only \\ndanced around all the faster. For one moment everything \\nremained still. ‘They aren’t opening,’ Gregor said to him -\\nself, caught up in some absurd hope. But of course then, as \\nusual, the servant girl with her firm tread went to the door \\nand opened it. Gregor needed to hear only the visitor’s first \\nword of greeting to recognize immediately who it was, the \\nmanager himself. Why was Gregor the only one condemned \\nto work in a firm where at the slightest lapse someone im -\\nmediately attracted the greatest suspicion? Were all the \\nemployees then collectively, one and all, scoundrels? Was \\nthere then among them no truly devoted person who, if he \\nfailed to use just a couple of hours in the morning for office \\nwork, would become abnormal from pangs of conscience \\nand really be in no state to get out of bed? Was it really not \\nenough to let an apprentice make inquiries, if such ques -\\ntioning was even necessary? Must the manager himself \\ncome, and in the process must it be demonstrated to the en -\\ntire innocent family that the investigation of this suspicious \\ncircumstance could only be entrusted to the intelligence \\nof the manager? And more as a consequence of the excited \\nstate in which this idea put Gregor than as a result of an \\nactual decision, he swung himself with all his might out of \\nthe bed. There was a loud thud, but not a real crash. The fall \\nwas absorbed somewhat by the carpet and, in addition, his \\nback was more elastic than Gregor had thought. For that \\nreason the dull noise was not quite so conspicuous. But he \\nhad not held his head up with sufficient care and had hit it. \\nHe turned his head, irritated and in pain, and rubbed it on \\n\\nThe Metamorphosis 1\\x18the carpet.\\n‘Something has fallen in there,’ said the manager in the \\nnext room on the left. Gregor tried to imagine to himself \\nwhether anything similar to what was happening to him to -\\nday could have also happened at some point to the manager. \\nAt least one had to concede the possibility of such a thing. \\nHowever, as if to give a rough answer to this question, the \\nmanager now took a few determined steps in the next room, \\nwith a squeak of his polished boots. From the neighbour -\\ning room on the right the sister was whispering to inform \\nGregor: ‘Gregor, the manager is here.’ ‘I know,’ said Gregor \\nto himself. But he did not dare make his voice loud enough \\nso that his sister could hear.\\n‘Gregor,’ his father now said from the neighbouring \\nroom on the left, ‘Mr. Manager has come and is asking why \\nyou have not left on the early train. We don’t know what we \\nshould tell him. Besides, he also wants to speak to you per -\\nsonally. So please open the door. He will good enough to \\nforgive the mess in your room.’\\nIn the middle of all this, the manager called out in a \\nfriendly way, ‘Good morning, Mr. Samsa.’ ‘He is not well,’ \\nsaid his mother to the manager, while his father was still \\ntalking at the door, ‘He is not well, believe me, Mr. Manager. \\nOtherwise how would Gregor miss a train! The young man \\nhas nothing in his head except business. I’m almost angry \\nthat he never goes out at night. Right now he’s been in the \\ncity eight days, but he’s been at home every evening. He sits \\nthere with us at the table and reads the newspaper quietly \\nor studies his travel schedules. It’s a quite a diversion for \\n\\n1\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.comhim if he busies himself with fretwork. For instance, he cut \\nout a small frame over the course of two or three evenings. \\nYou’d be amazed how pretty it is. It’s hanging right inside \\nthe room. You’ll see it immediately, as soon as Gregor opens \\nthe door. Anyway, I’m happy that you’re here, Mr. Manager. \\nBy ourselves, we would never have made Gregor open the \\ndoor. He’s so stubborn, and he’s certainly not well, although \\nhe denied that this morning.’\\n‘I’m coming right away,’ said Gregor slowly and delib -\\nerately and didn’t move, so as not to lose one word of the \\nconversation. ‘My dear lady, I cannot explain it to myself \\nin any other way,’ said the manager; ‘I hope it is nothing se -\\nrious. On the other hand, I must also say that we business \\npeople, luckily or unluckily, however one looks at it, very \\noften simply have to overcome a slight indisposition for \\nbusiness reasons.’ ‘So can Mr. Manager come in to see you \\nnow’ asked his father impatiently and knocked once again \\non the door. ‘No,’ said Gregor. In the neighbouring room on \\nthe left a painful stillness descended. In the neighbouring \\nroom on the right the sister began to sob.\\nWhy didn’t his sister go to the others? She’d probably \\njust gotten up out of bed now and hadn’t even started to get \\ndressed yet. Then why was she crying? Because he wasn’t \\ngetting up and wasn’t letting the manager in; because he \\nwas in danger of losing his position, and because then his \\nboss would badger his parents once again with the old de -\\nmands? Those were probably unnecessary worries right \\nnow. Gregor was still here and wasn’t thinking at all about \\nabandoning his family. At the moment he was lying right \\n\\nThe Metamorphosis 1\\x18there on the carpet, and no one who knew about his condi -\\ntion would’ve seriously demanded that he let the manager \\nin. But Gregor wouldn’t be casually dismissed right way be -\\ncause of this small discourtesy, for which he would find an \\neasy and suitable excuse later on. It seemed to Gregor that \\nit might be far more reasonable to leave him in peace at the \\nmoment, instead of disturbing him with crying and conver -\\nsation. But it was the very uncertainty which distressed the \\nothers and excused their behaviour.\\n‘Mr. Samsa,’ the manager was now shouting, his voice \\nraised, ‘what’s the matter? You are barricading yourself in \\nyour room, answer with only a yes and a no, are making \\nserious and unnecessary troubles for your parents, and ne -\\nglecting (I mention this only incidentally) your commercial \\nduties in a truly unheard of manner. I am speaking here in \\nthe name of your parents and your employer, and I am re -\\nquesting you in all seriousness for an immediate and clear \\nexplanation. I am amazed. I am amazed. I thought I knew \\nyou as a calm, reasonable person, and now you appear sud -\\ndenly to want to start parading around in weird moods. The \\nChief indicated to me earlier this very day a possible expla -\\nnation for your neglect—it concerned the collection of cash \\nentrusted to you a short while ago—but in truth I almost \\ngave him my word of honour that this explanation could \\nnot be correct. However, now I see here your unimaginable \\npig headedness, and I am totally losing any desire to speak \\nup for you in the slightest. And your position is not at all the \\nmost secure. Originally I intended to mention all this to you \\nprivately, but since you are letting me waste my time here \\n\\n1\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.comuselessly, I don’t know why the matter shouldn’t come to the \\nattention of your parents. Your productivity has also been \\nvery unsatisfactory recently. Of course, it’s not the time of \\nyear to conduct exceptional business, we recognize that, but \\na time of year for conducting no business, there is no such \\nthing at all, Mr. Samsa, and such a thing must never be.’\\n‘But Mr. Manager,’ called Gregor, beside himself and in \\nhis agitation forgetting everything else, ‘I’m opening the \\ndoor immediately, this very moment. A slight indisposition, \\na dizzy spell, has prevented me from getting up. I’m still \\nlying in bed right now. But now I’m quite refreshed once \\nagain. I’m in the midst of getting out of bed. Just have pa -\\ntience for a short moment! Things are not going so well as \\nI thought. But things are all right. How suddenly this can \\novercome someone! Just yesterday evening everything was \\nfine with me. My parents certainly know that. Actually just \\nyesterday evening I had a small premonition. People must \\nhave seen that in me. Why have I not reported that to the \\noffice! But people always think that they’ll get over sickness \\nwithout having to stay at home. Mr. Manager! Take it easy \\non my parents! There is really no basis for the criticisms \\nwhich you are now making against me, and really nobody \\nhas said a word to me about that. Perhaps you have not read \\nthe latest orders which I shipped. Besides, now I’m setting \\nout on my trip on the eight o’clock train; the few hours’ rest \\nhave made me stronger. Mr. Manager, do not stay. I will be \\nat the office in person right away. Please have the goodness \\nto say that and to convey my respects to the Chief.’\\nWhile Gregor was quickly blurting all this out, hard -\\n\\nThe Metamorphosis 1\\x18ly aware of what he was saying, he had moved close to the \\nchest of drawers without effort, probably as a result of the \\npractice he had already had in bed, and now he was trying \\nto raise himself up on it. Actually, he wanted to open the \\ndoor; he really wanted to let himself be seen by and to speak \\nwith the manager. He was keen to witness what the others \\nnow asking after him would say at the sight of him. If they \\nwere startled, then Gregor had no more responsibility and \\ncould be calm. But if they accepted everything quietly, then \\nhe would have no reason to get excited and, if he got a move \\non, could really be at the station around eight o’clock.\\nAt first he slid down a few times from the smooth chest of \\ndrawers. But at last he gave himself a final swing and stood \\nupright there. He was no longer at all aware of the pains in \\nhis lower body, no matter how they might still sting. Now \\nhe let himself fall against the back of a nearby chair, on the \\nedge of which he braced himself with his thin limbs. By do -\\ning this he gained control over himself and kept quiet, for \\nhe could now hear the manager.\\n‘Did you understood a single word?’ the manager asked \\nthe parents, ‘Is he playing the fool with us?’ ‘For God’s sake,’ \\ncried the mother already in tears, ‘perhaps he’s very ill and \\nwe’re upsetting him. Grete! Grete!’ she yelled at that point. \\n‘Mother?’ called the sister from the other side. They were \\nmaking themselves understood through Gregor’s room. \\n‘You must go to the doctor right away. Gregor is sick. Hurry \\nto the doctor. Have you heard Gregor speak yet?’ ‘That was \\nan animal’s voice,’ said the manager, remarkably quietly in \\ncomparison to the mother’s cries.\\n\\n1\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.com‘Anna! Anna!’ yelled the father through the hall into the \\nkitchen, clapping his hands, ‘fetch a locksmith right away!’ \\nThe two young women were already running through the \\nhall with swishing skirts (how had his sister dressed herself \\nso quickly?) and yanked open the doors of the apartment. \\nOne couldn’t hear the doors closing at all. They probably \\nhad left them open, as is customary in an apartment in \\nwhich a huge misfortune has taken place.\\nHowever, Gregor had become much calmer. All right, \\npeople did not understand his words any more, although \\nthey seemed clear enough to him, clearer than previously, \\nperhaps because his ears had gotten used to them. But at \\nleast people now thought that things were not all right with \\nhim and were prepared to help him. The confidence and as -\\nsurance with which the first arrangements had been carried \\nout made him feel good. He felt himself included once again \\nin the circle of humanity and was expecting from both the \\ndoctor and the locksmith, without differentiating between \\nthem with any real precision, splendid and surprising re -\\nsults. In order to get as clear a voice as possible for the critical \\nconversation which was imminent, he coughed a little, and \\ncertainly took the trouble to do this in a really subdued way, \\nsince it was possible that even this noise sounded like some -\\nthing different from a human cough. He no longer trusted \\nhimself to decide any more. Meanwhile in the next room it \\nhad become really quiet. Perhaps his parents were sitting \\nwith the manager at the table and were whispering; perhaps \\nthey were all leaning against the door and listening.\\nGregor pushed himself slowly towards the door, with the \\n\\nThe Metamorphosis 1\\x18help of the easy chair, let go of it there, threw himself against \\nthe door, held himself upright against it (the balls of his tiny \\nlimbs had a little sticky stuff on them), and rested there mo -\\nmentarily from his exertion. Then he made an effort to turn \\nthe key in the lock with his mouth. Unfortunately it seemed \\nthat he had no real teeth. How then was he to grab hold \\nof the key? But to make up for that his jaws were naturally \\nvery strong; with their help he managed to get the key really \\nmoving, and he did not notice that he was obviously inflict -\\ning some damage on himself, for a brown fluid came out of \\nhis mouth, flowed over the key, and dripped onto the floor.\\n‘Just listen for a moment,’ said the manager in the next \\nroom, ‘he’s turning the key.’ For Gregor that was a great \\nencouragement. But they all should’ve called out to him, \\nincluding his father and mother, ‘Come on, Gregor,’ they \\nshould’ve shouted, ‘keep going, keep working on the lock.’ \\nImagining that all his efforts were being followed with sus -\\npense, he bit down frantically on the key with all the force \\nhe could muster. As the key turned more, he danced around \\nthe lock. Now he was holding himself upright only with his \\nmouth, and he had to hang onto the key or then press it \\ndown again with the whole weight of his body, as necessary. \\nThe quite distinct click of the lock as it finally snapped re -\\nally woke Gregor up. Breathing heavily he said to himself, \\n‘So I didn’t need the locksmith,’ and he set his head against \\nthe door handle to open the door completely.\\nBecause he had to open the door in this way, it was already \\nopen very wide without him yet being really visible. He first \\nhad to turn himself slowly around the edge of the door, very \\n\\n1\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.comcarefully, of course, if he did not want to fall awkwardly on \\nhis back right at the entrance into the room. He was still \\npreoccupied with this difficult movement and had no time \\nto pay attention to anything else, when he heard the manag -\\ner exclaim a loud ‘Oh!’ (it sounded like the wind whistling), \\nand now he saw him, nearest to the door, pressing his hand \\nagainst his open mouth and moving slowly back, as if an \\ninvisible constant force was pushing him away. His mother \\n(in spite of the presence of the manager she was standing \\nhere with her hair sticking up on end, still a mess from the \\nnight) with her hands clasped was looking at his father; she \\nthen went two steps towards Gregor and collapsed right in \\nthe middle of her skirts spreading out all around her, her \\nface sunk on her breast, completely concealed. His father \\nclenched his fist with a hostile expression, as if he wished \\nto push Gregor back into his room, then looked uncertainly \\naround the living room, covered his eyes with his hands, \\nand cried so that his mighty breast shook.\\nAt this point Gregor did not take one step into the room, \\nbut leaned his body from the inside against the firmly bolt -\\ned wing of the door, so that only half his body was visible, \\nas well as his head, titled sideways, with which he peeped \\nover at the others. Meanwhile it had become much brighter. \\nStanding out clearly from the other side of the street was \\na part of the endless gray-black house situated opposite (it \\nwas a hospital) with its severe regular windows breaking \\nup the facade. The rain was still coming down, but only in \\nlarge individual drops visibly and firmly thrown down one \\nby one onto the ground. The breakfast dishes were standing \\n\\nThe Metamorphosis \\x180piled around on the table, because for his father breakfast \\nwas the most important meal time in the day, which he pro -\\nlonged for hours by reading various newspapers. Directly \\nacross on the opposite wall hung a photograph of Gregor \\nfrom the time of his military service; it was a picture of him \\nas a lieutenant, as he, smiling and worry free, with his hand \\non his sword, demanded respect for his bearing and uni -\\nform. The door to the hall was ajar, and since the door to the \\napartment was also open, one saw out into the landing of \\nthe apartment and the start of the staircase going down.\\n‘Now,’ said Gregor, well aware that he was the only one \\nwho had kept his composure. ‘I’ll get dressed right away, \\npack up the collection of samples, and set off. You’ll allow \\nme to set out on my way, will you not? You see, Mr. Manag -\\ner, I am not pig-headed, and I am happy to work. Traveling \\nis exhausting, but I couldn’t live without it. Where are you \\ngoing, Mr. Manager? To the office? Really? Will you report \\neverything truthfully? A person can be incapable of work \\nmomentarily, but that is precisely the best time to remem -\\nber the earlier achievements and to consider that later, after \\nthe obstacles have been shoved aside, the person will work \\nall the more keenly and intensely. I am really so indebted to \\nMr. Chief—you know that perfectly well. On the other hand, \\nI am concerned about my parents and my sister. I’m in a fix, \\nbut I’ll work myself out of it again. Don’t make things more \\ndifficult for me than they already are. Speak up on my behalf \\nin the office! People don’t like traveling salesmen. I know \\nthat. People think they earn pots of money and thus lead a \\nfine life. People don’t even have any special reason to think \\n\\n\\x181 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.comthrough this judgment more clearly. But you, Mr. Manag -\\ner, you have a better perspective on the interconnections \\nthan the other people, even, I tell you in total confidence, a \\nbetter perspective than Mr. Chairman himself, who in his \\ncapacity as the employer may let his judgment make casual \\nmistakes at the expense of an employee. You also know well \\nenough that the traveling salesman who is outside the of -\\nfice almost the entire year can become so easily a victim \\nof gossip, coincidences, and groundless complaints, against \\nwhich it’s impossible for him to defend himself, since for the \\nmost part he doesn’t hear about them at all and only then \\nwhen he’s exhausted after finishing a trip, and gets to feel in \\nhis own body at home the nasty consequences, which can’t \\nbe thoroughly explored back to their origins. Mr. Manager, \\ndon’t leave without speaking a word telling me that you’ll at \\nleast concede that I’m a little in the right!’\\nBut at Gregor’s first words the manager had already turned \\naway, and now he looked back at Gregor over his twitching \\nshoulders with pursed lips. During Gregor’s speech he was \\nnot still for a moment, but was moving away towards the \\ndoor, without taking his eyes off Gregor, but really gradu -\\nally, as if there was a secret ban on leaving the room. He was \\nalready in the hall, and after the sudden movement with \\nwhich he finally pulled his foot out of the living room, one \\ncould have believed that he had just burned the sole of his \\nfoot. In the hall, however, he stretched out his right hand \\naway from his body towards the staircase, as if some truly \\nsupernatural relief was waiting for him there.\\nGregor realized that he must not under any circum -\\n\\nThe Metamorphosis \\x18\\x18stances allow the manager to go away in this frame of mind, \\nespecially if his position in the firm was not to be placed \\nin the greatest danger. His parents did not understand all \\nthis very well. Over the long years, they had developed the \\nconviction that Gregor was set up for life in his firm and, \\nin addition, they had so much to do nowadays with their \\npresent troubles that all foresight was foreign to them. But \\nGregor had this foresight. The manager must be held back, \\ncalmed down, convinced, and finally won over. The future \\nof Gregor and his family really depended on it! If only the \\nsister had been there! She was clever. She had already cried \\nwhile Gregor was still lying quietly on his back. And the \\nmanager, this friend of the ladies, would certainly let him -\\nself be guided by her. She would have closed the door to \\nthe apartment and talked him out of his fright in the hall. \\nBut the sister was not even there. Gregor must deal with it \\nhimself.\\nWithout thinking that as yet he didn’t know anything \\nabout his present ability to move and without thinking \\nthat his speech possibly (indeed probably) had once again \\nnot been understood, he left the wing of the door, pushed \\nhimself through the opening, and wanted to go over to the \\nmanager, who was already holding tight onto the handrail \\nwith both hands on the landing in a ridiculous way. But as \\nhe looked for something to hold onto, with a small scream \\nGregor immediately fell down onto his numerous little legs. \\nScarcely had this happened, when he felt for the first time \\nthat morning a general physical well being. The small limbs \\nhad firm floor under them; they obeyed perfectly, as he \\n\\n\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.comnoticed to his joy, and strove to carry him forward in the \\ndirection he wanted. Right away he believed that the final \\namelioration of all his suffering was immediately at hand. \\nBut at the very moment when he lay on the floor rocking in \\na restrained manner quite close and directly across from his \\nmother (apparently totally sunk into herself) she suddenly \\nsprang right up with her arms spread far apart and her fin -\\ngers extended and cried out, ‘Help, for God’s sake, help!’ She \\nheld her head bowed down, as if she wanted to view Gregor \\nbetter, but ran senselessly back, contradicting that gesture, \\nforgetting that behind her stood the table with all the dishes \\non it. When she reached the table, she sat down heavily on \\nit, as if absent-mindedly, and did not appear to notice at all \\nthat next to her coffee was pouring out onto the carpet in a \\nfull stream from the large overturned container.\\n‘Mother, mother,’ said Gregor quietly, and looked over \\ntowards her. The manager momentarily had disappeared \\ncompletely from his mind; by contrast, at the sight of the \\nflowing coffee he couldn’t stop himself snapping his jaws \\nin the air a few times . At that his mother screamed all over \\nagain, hurried from the table, and collapsed into the arms of \\nhis father, who was rushing towards her. But Gregor had no \\ntime right now for his parents: the manager was already on \\nthe staircase. His chin level with the banister, the manager \\nlooked back for the last time. Gregor took an initial move -\\nment to catch up to him if possible. But the manager must \\nhave suspected something, because he made a leap down \\nover a few stairs and disappeared, still shouting ‘Huh!’ The \\nsound echoed throughout the entire stairwell.\\n\\nThe Metamorphosis \\x18\\x18Now, unfortunately this flight of the manager also \\nseemed completely to bewilder his father, who earlier had \\nbeen relatively calm, for instead of running after the manag -\\ner himself or at least not hindering Gregor from his pursuit, \\nwith his right hand he grabbed hold of the manager’s cane, \\nwhich he had left behind with his hat and overcoat on a \\nchair. With his left hand, his father picked up a large news -\\npaper from the table and, stamping his feet on the floor, he \\nset out to drive Gregor back into his room by waving the \\ncane and the newspaper. No request of Gregor’s was of any \\nuse; no request would even be understood. No matter how \\nwilling he was to turn his head respectfully, his father just \\nstomped all the harder with his feet.\\nAcross the room from him his mother had pulled open \\na window, in spite of the cool weather, and leaning out with \\nher hands on her cheeks, she pushed her face far outside \\nthe window. Between the alley and the stair well a strong \\ndraught came up, the curtains on the window flew around, \\nthe newspapers on the table swished, and individual sheets \\nfluttered down over the floor. The father relentlessly pressed \\nforward pushing out sibilants, like a wild man. Now, Gregor \\nhad no practice at all in going backwards; it was really going \\nvery slowly. If Gregor only had been allowed to turn himself \\naround, he would have been in his room right away, but he \\nwas afraid to make his father impatient by the time-consum -\\ning process of turning around, and each moment he faced \\nthe threat of a mortal blow on his back or his head from the \\ncane in his father’s hand. Finally Gregor had no other op -\\ntion, for he noticed with horror that he did not understand \\n\\n\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.comyet how to maintain his direction going backwards. And so \\nhe began, amid constantly anxious sideways glances in his \\nfather’s direction, to turn himself around as quickly as pos -\\nsible (although in truth this was only very slowly). Perhaps \\nhis father noticed his good intentions, for he did not disrupt \\nGregor in this motion, but with the tip of the cane from a \\ndistance he even directed here and there Gregor’s rotating \\nmovement.\\nIf only there hadn’t been his father’s unbearable hissing! \\nBecause of that Gregor totally lost his head. He was already \\nalmost totally turned around, when, always with this hiss -\\ning in his ear, he just made a mistake and turned himself \\nback a little. But when he finally was successful in getting \\nhis head in front of the door opening, it became clear that \\nhis body was too wide to go through any further. Natu -\\nrally his father, in his present mental state, had no idea of \\nopening the other wing of the door a bit to create a suitable \\npassage for Gregor to get through. His single fixed thought \\nwas that Gregor must get into his room as quickly as possi -\\nble. He would never have allowed the elaborate preparations \\nthat Gregor required to orient himself and thus perhaps \\nget through the door. On the contrary, as if there were no \\nobstacle and with a peculiar noise, he now drove Gregor for -\\nwards. Behind Gregor the sound was at this point no longer \\nlike the voice of only a single father. Now it was really no \\nlonger a joke, and Gregor forced himself, come what might, \\ninto the door. One side of his body was lifted up. He lay at an \\nangle in the door opening. His one flank was sore with the \\nscraping. On the white door ugly blotches were left. Soon \\n\\nThe Metamorphosis \\x18\\x18he was stuck fast and would have not been able to move any \\nmore on his own. The tiny legs on one side hung twitch -\\ning in the air above, the ones on the other side were pushed \\npainfully into the floor. Then his father gave him one really \\nstrong liberating push from behind, and he scurried, bleed -\\ning severely, far into the interior of his room. The door was \\nslammed shut with the cane, and finally it was quiet.\\n\\n\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.comII \\nGregor first woke up from his heavy swoon-like sleep \\nin the evening twilight. He would certainly have wo -\\nken up soon afterwards without any disturbance, for he felt \\nhimself sufficiently rested and wide awake, although it ap -\\npeared to him as if a hurried step and a cautious closing of \\nthe door to the hall had aroused him. The shine of the elec -\\ntric streetlights lay pale here and there on the ceiling and on \\nthe higher parts of the furniture, but underneath around \\nGregor it was dark. He pushed himself slowly toward the \\ndoor, still groping awkwardly with his feelers, which he \\nnow learned to value for the first time, to check what was \\nhappening there. His left side seemed one single long un -\\npleasantly stretched scar, and he really had to hobble on his \\ntwo rows of legs. In addition, one small leg had been seri -\\nously wounded in the course of the morning incident (it was \\nalmost a miracle that only one had been hurt) and dragged \\nlifelessly behind.\\nBy the door he first noticed what had really lured him \\nthere: it was the smell of something to eat. For there stood a \\nbowl filled with sweetened milk, in which swam tiny piec -\\nes of white bread. He almost laughed with joy, for he now \\nhad a much greater hunger than in the morning, and he im -\\nmediately dipped his head almost up to and over his eyes \\ndown into the milk. But he soon drew it back again in dis -\\n\\nThe Metamorphosis \\x18\\x18appointment, not just because it was difficult for him to eat \\non account of his delicate left side (he could eat only if his \\nentire panting body worked in a coordinated way), but also \\nbecause the milk, which otherwise was his favorite drink \\nand which his sister had certainly placed there for that rea -\\nson, did not appeal to him at all. He turned away from the \\nbowl almost with aversion and crept back into the middle \\nof the room.\\nIn the living room, as Gregor saw through the crack in \\nthe door, the gas was lit, but where on other occasions at this \\ntime of day the father was accustomed to read the afternoon \\nnewspaper in a loud voice to his mother and sometimes also \\nto his sister, at the moment not a sound was audible. Now, \\nperhaps this reading aloud, about which his sister always \\nspoken and written to him, had recently fallen out of their \\ngeneral routine. But it was so still all around, in spite of the \\nfact that the apartment was certainly not empty. ‘What a \\nquiet life the family leads’, said Gregor to himself and, as he \\nstared fixedly out in front of him into the darkness, he felt \\na great pride that he had been able to provide such a life in \\na beautiful apartment like this for his parents and his sister. \\nBut how would things go if now all tranquillity, all prosper -\\nity, all contentment should come to a horrible end? In order \\nnot to lose himself in such thoughts, Gregor preferred to set \\nhimself moving and crawled up and down in his room.\\nOnce during the long evening one side door and then the \\nother door was opened just a tiny crack and quickly closed \\nagain. Someone presumably needed to come in but had then \\nthought better of it. Gregor immediately took up a position \\n\\n\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.comby the living room door, determined to bring in the hesitant \\nvisitor somehow or other or at least to find out who it might \\nbe. But now the door was not opened any more, and Gregor \\nwaited in vain. Earlier, when the door had been barred, they \\nhad all wanted to come in to him; now, when he had opened \\none door and when the others had obviously been opened \\nduring the day, no one came any more, and the keys were \\nstuck in the locks on the outside.\\nThe light in the living room was turned off only late at \\nnight, and now it was easy to establish that his parents and \\nhis sister had stayed awake all this time, for one could hear \\nclearly as all three moved away on tiptoe. Now it was cer -\\ntain that no one would come into Gregor any more until \\nthe morning. Thus, he had a long time to think undisturbed \\nabout how he should reorganize his life from scratch. But \\nthe high, open room, in which he was compelled to lie flat \\non the floor, made him anxious, without his being able to \\nfigure out the reason, for he had lived in the room for five \\nyears. With a half unconscious turn and not without a slight \\nshame he scurried under the couch, where, in spite of the \\nfact that his back was a little cramped and he could no lon -\\nger lift up his head, he felt very comfortable and was sorry \\nonly that his body was too wide to fit completely under it.\\nThere he remained the entire night, which he spent partly \\nin a state of semi-sleep, out of which his hunger constantly \\nwoke him with a start, but partly in a state of worry and \\nmurky hopes, which all led to the conclusion that for the \\ntime being he would have to keep calm and with patience \\nand the greatest consideration for his family tolerate the \\n\\nThe Metamorphosis \\x180troubles which in his present condition he was now forced \\nto cause them.\\nAlready early in the morning (it was still almost night) \\nGregor had an opportunity to test the power of the deci -\\nsions he had just made, for his sister, almost fully dressed, \\nopened the door from the hall into his room and looked ea -\\ngerly inside. She did not find him immediately, but when she \\nnoticed him under the couch (God, he had to be somewhere \\nor other; for he could hardly fly away) she got such a shock \\nthat, without being able to control herself, she slammed the \\ndoor shut once again from the outside. However, as if she \\nwas sorry for her behaviour, she immediately opened the \\ndoor again and walked in on her tiptoes, as if she was in \\nthe presence of a serious invalid or a total stranger. Gregor \\nhad pushed his head forward just to the edge of the couch \\nand was observing her. Would she really notice that he had \\nleft the milk standing, not indeed from any lack of hunger, \\nand would she bring in something else to eat more suitable \\nfor him? If she did not do it on her own, he would sooner \\nstarve to death than call her attention to the fact, although \\nhe had a really powerful urge to move beyond the couch, \\nthrow himself at his sister’s feet, and beg her for something \\nor other good to eat. But his sister noticed right away with \\nastonishment that the bowl was still full, with only a little \\nmilk spilled around it. She picked it up immediately (al -\\nthough not with her bare hands but with a rag), and took \\nit out of the room. Gregor was extremely curious what she \\nwould bring as a substitute, and he pictured to himself dif -\\nferent ideas about that. But he never could have guessed \\n\\n\\x181 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.comwhat his sister out of the goodness of her heart in fact did. \\nShe brought him, to test his taste, an entire selection, all \\nspread out on an old newspaper. There were old half-rot -\\nten vegetables, bones from the evening meal, covered with \\na white sauce which had almost solidified, some raisins \\nand almonds, cheese, which Gregor had declared inedible \\ntwo days earlier, a slice of dry bread, a slice of salted bread \\nsmeared with butter. In addition to all this, she put down a \\nbowl (probably designated once and for all as Gregor’s) into \\nwhich she had poured some water. And out of her delicacy \\nof feeling, since she knew that Gregor would not eat in front \\nof her, she went away very quickly and even turned the key \\nin the lock, so that Gregor could now observe that he could \\nmake himself as comfortable as he wished. Gregor’s small \\nlimbs buzzed as the time for eating had come. His wounds \\nmust, in any case, have already healed completely. He felt \\nno handicap on that score. He was astonished at that and \\nthought about it, how more than a month ago he had cut his \\nfinger slightly with a knife and how this wound had hurt \\nenough even the day before yesterday.\\n‘Am I now going to be less sensitive,’ he thought, already \\nsucking greedily on the cheese, which had strongly attract -\\ned him right away, more than all the other foods. Quickly \\nand with his eyes watering with satisfaction, he ate one after \\nthe other the cheese, the vegetables, and the sauce; the fresh \\nfood, by contrast, didn’t taste good to him. He couldn’t bear \\nthe smell and even carried the things he wanted to eat a \\nlittle distance away. By the time his sister slowly turned the \\nkey as a sign that he should withdraw, he was long finished \\n\\nThe Metamorphosis \\x18\\x18and now lay lazily in the same spot. The noise immediately \\nstartled him, in spite of the fact that he was already almost \\nasleep, and he scurried back again under the couch. But it \\ncost him great self-control to remain under the couch, even \\nfor the short time his sister was in the room, because his \\nbody had filled out somewhat on account of the rich meal \\nand in the narrow space there he could scarcely breathe. \\nIn the midst of minor attacks of asphyxiation, he looked \\nat her with somewhat protruding eyes, as his unsuspect -\\ning sister swept up with a broom, not just the remnants, but \\neven the foods which Gregor had not touched at all, as if \\nthese were also now useless, and as she dumped everything \\nquickly into a bucket, which she closed with a wooden lid, \\nand then carried all of it out of the room. She had hardly \\nturned around before Gregor had already dragged himself \\nout from the couch, stretched out, and let his body expand.\\nIn this way Gregor got his food every day, once in the \\nmorning, when his parents and the servant girl were still \\nasleep, and a second time after the common noon meal, for \\nhis parents were, as before, asleep then for a little while, and \\nthe servant girl was sent off by his sister on some errand \\nor other. Certainly they would not have wanted Gregor to \\nstarve to death, but perhaps they could not have endured \\nfinding out what he ate other than by hearsay. Perhaps his \\nsister wanted to spare them what was possibly only a small \\ngrief, for they were really suffering quite enough already.\\nWhat sorts of excuses people had used on that first \\nmorning to get the doctor and the locksmith out of the \\nhouse Gregor was completely unable to ascertain. Since he \\n\\n\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.comwas not comprehensible, no one, not even his sister, thought \\nthat he might be able to understand others, and thus, when \\nhis sister was in her room, he had to be content with listen -\\ning now and then to her sighs and invocations to the saints. \\nOnly later, when she had grown somewhat accustomed to \\neverything (naturally there could never be any talk of her \\ngrowing completely accustomed to it) Gregor sometimes \\ncaught a comment which was intended to be friendly or \\ncould be interpreted as such. ‘Well, today it tasted good to \\nhim,’ she said, if Gregor had really cleaned up what he had \\nto eat; whereas, in the reverse situation, which gradually \\nrepeated itself more and more frequently, she used to say \\nsadly, ‘Now everything has stopped again.’\\nBut while Gregor could get no new information direct -\\nly, he did hear a good deal from the room next door, and \\nas soon as he heard voices, he scurried right away to the \\nrelevant door and pressed his entire body against it. In \\nthe early days especially, there was no conversation which \\nwas not concerned with him in some way or other, even if \\nonly in secret. For two days at all meal times discussions \\non that subject could be heard on how people should now \\nbehave; but they also talked about the same subject in the \\ntimes between meals, for there were always at least two \\nfamily members at home, since no one really wanted to re -\\nmain in the house alone and people could not under any \\ncircumstances leave the apartment completely empty. In \\naddition, on the very first day the servant girl (it was not \\ncompletely clear what and how much she knew about what \\nhad happened) on her knees had begged his mother to let \\n\\nThe Metamorphosis \\x18\\x18her go immediately, and when she said good bye about fif -\\nteen minutes later, she thanked them for the dismissal with \\ntears in her eyes, as if she was receiving the greatest favour \\nwhich people had shown her there, and, without anyone de -\\nmanding it from her, she swore a fearful oath not to betray \\nanyone, not even the slightest bit.\\nNow his sister had to team up with his mother to do the \\ncooking, although that didn’t create much trouble because \\npeople were eating almost nothing. Again and again Gregor \\nlistened as one of them vainly invited another one to eat and \\nreceived no answer other than ‘Thank you. I have enough’ \\nor something like that. And perhaps they had stopped hav -\\ning anything to drink, too. His sister often asked his father \\nwhether he wanted to have a beer and gladly offered to fetch \\nit herself, and when his father was silent, she said, in order \\nto remove any reservations he might have, that she could \\nsend the caretaker’s wife to get it. But then his father finally \\nsaid a resounding ‘No,’ and nothing more would be spoken \\nabout it.\\nAlready during the first day his father laid out all the \\nfinancial circumstances and prospects to his mother and \\nto his sister as well. From time to time he stood up from \\nthe table and pulled out of the small lockbox salvaged from \\nhis business, which had collapsed five years previously, \\nsome document or other or some notebook. The sound was \\naudible as he opened up the complicated lock and, after re -\\nmoving what he was looking for, locked it up again. These \\nexplanations by his father were, in part, the first enjoyable \\nthing that Gregor had the chance to listen to since his im -\\n\\n\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.comprisonment. He had thought that nothing at all was left over \\nfor his father from that business; at least his father had told \\nhim nothing to the contradict that view, and Gregor in any \\ncase hadn’t asked him about it. At the time Gregor’s only \\nconcern had been to devote everything he had in order to \\nallow his family to forget as quickly as possible the busi -\\nness misfortune which had brought them all into a state of \\ncomplete hopelessness. And so at that point he’d started \\nto work with a special intensity and from an assistant had \\nbecome, almost overnight, a traveling salesman, who natu -\\nrally had entirely different possibilities for earning money \\nand whose successes at work at once were converted into \\nthe form of cash commissions, which could be set out on \\nthe table at home in front of his astonished and delighted \\nfamily. Those had been beautiful days, and they had never \\ncome back afterwards, at least not with the same splendour, \\nin spite of the fact that Gregor later earned so much money \\nthat he was in a position to bear the expenses of the entire \\nfamily, expenses which he, in fact, did bear. They had be -\\ncome quite accustomed to it, both the family and Gregor \\nas well. They took the money with thanks, and he happily \\nsurrendered it, but the special warmth was no longer pres -\\nent. Only the sister had remained still close to Gregor, and \\nit was his secret plan to send her (in contrast to Gregor she \\nloved music very much and knew how to play the violin \\ncharmingly) next year to the conservatory, regardless of the \\ngreat expense which that must necessitate and which would \\nbe made up in other ways. Now and then during Gregor’s \\nshort stays in the city the conservatory was mentioned in \\n\\nThe Metamorphosis \\x18\\x18conversations with his sister, but always only as a beauti -\\nful dream, whose realization was unimaginable, and their \\nparents never listened to these innocent expectations with \\npleasure. But Gregor thought about them with scrupulous \\nconsideration and intended to explain the matter ceremoni -\\nously on Christmas Eve.\\nIn his present situation, such futile ideas went through \\nhis head, while he pushed himself right up against the \\ndoor and listened. Sometimes in his general exhaustion \\nhe couldn’t listen any more and let his head bang listlessly \\nagainst the door, but he immediately pulled himself togeth -\\ner, for even the small sound which he made by this motion \\nwas heard near by and silenced everyone. ‘ There he goes on \\nagain,’ said his father after a while, clearly turning towards \\nthe door, and only then would the interrupted conversation \\ngradually be resumed again.\\nGregor found out clearly enough (for his father tended \\nto repeat himself often in his explanations, partly because \\nhe had not personally concerned himself with these mat -\\nters for a long time now, and partly also because his mother \\ndid not understand everything right away the first time) \\nthat, in spite all bad luck, a fortune, although a very small \\none, was available from the old times, which the interest \\n(which had not been touched) had in the intervening time \\ngradually allowed to increase a little. Furthermore, in ad -\\ndition to this, the money which Gregor had brought home \\nevery month (he had kept only a few florins for himself) \\nhad not been completely spent and had grown into a small \\ncapital amount. Gregor, behind his door, nodded eagerly, \\n\\n\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.comrejoicing over this unanticipated foresight and frugality. \\nTrue, with this excess money, he could have paid off more \\nof his father’s debt to his employer and the day on which he \\ncould be rid of this position would have been a lot closer, \\nbut now things were doubtless better the way his father had \\narranged them.\\nAt the moment, however, this money was nowhere near \\nsufficient to permit the family to live on the interest pay -\\nments. Perhaps it would be enough to maintain the family \\nfor one or at most two years, that’s all. Thus it came only to \\nan amount which one should not really take out and which \\nmust be set aside for an emergency. But the money to live \\non must be earned. Now, his father was a healthy man, al -\\nthough he was old, who had not worked at all for five years \\nnow and thus could not be counted on for very much. He \\nhad in these five years, the first holidays of his trouble-filled \\nbut unsuccessful life, put on a good deal of fat and thus had \\nbecome really heavy. And should his old mother now may -\\nbe work for money, a woman who suffered from asthma, \\nfor whom wandering through the apartment even now was \\na great strain and who spent every second day on the sofa \\nby the open window labouring for breath? Should his sis -\\nter earn money, a girl who was still a seventeen-year-old \\nchild, whose earlier life style had been so very delightful \\nthat it had consisted of dressing herself nicely, sleeping in \\nlate, helping around the house, taking part in a few mod -\\nest enjoyments and, above all, playing the violin? When \\nit came to talking about this need to earn money, at first \\nGregor went away from the door and threw himself on the \\n\\nThe Metamorphosis \\x18\\x18cool leather sofa beside the door, for he was quite hot from \\nshame and sorrow.\\nOften he lay there all night long. He didn’t sleep a mo -\\nment and just scratched on the leather for hours at a time. \\nHe undertook the very difficult task of shoving a chair over \\nto the window. Then he crept up on the window sill and, \\nbraced in the chair, leaned against the window to look out, \\nobviously with some memory or other of the satisfaction \\nwhich that used to bring him in earlier times. Actually from \\nday to day he perceived things with less and less clarity, even \\nthose a short distance away: the hospital across the street, \\nthe all too frequent sight of which he had previously cursed, \\nwas not visible at all any more, and if he had not been pre -\\ncisely aware that he lived in the quiet but completely urban \\nCharlotte Street, he could have believed that from his win -\\ndow he was peering out at a featureless wasteland, in which \\nthe gray heaven and the gray earth had merged and were \\nindistinguishable. His attentive sister must have observed \\na couple of times that the chair stood by the window; then, \\nafter cleaning up the room, each time she pushed the chair \\nback right against the window and from now on she even \\nleft the inner casement open.\\nIf Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and \\nthank her for everything that she had to do for him, he \\nwould have tolerated her service more easily. As it was he \\nsuffered under it. The sister admittedly sought to cover up \\nthe awkwardness of everything as much as possible, and, \\nas time went by, she naturally got more successful at it. But \\nwith the passing of time Gregor also came to understand \\n\\n\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.comeverything more precisely. Even her entrance was terrible \\nfor him. As soon as she entered, she ran straight to the win -\\ndow, without taking the time to shut the door (in spite of \\nthe fact that she was otherwise very considerate in sparing \\nanyone the sight of Gregor’s room), and yanked the window \\nopen with eager hands, as if she was almost suffocating, and \\nremained for a while by the window breathing deeply, even \\nwhen it was still so cold. With this running and noise she \\nfrightened Gregor twice every day. The entire time he trem -\\nbled under the couch, and yet he knew very well that she \\nwould certainly have spared him gladly if it had only been \\npossible to remain with the window closed in a room where \\nGregor lived.\\nOn one occasion (about one month had already gone by \\nsince Gregor’s transformation, and there was now no partic -\\nular reason any more for his sister to be startled at Gregor’s \\nappearance) she came a little earlier than usual and came \\nupon Gregor as he was still looking out the window, im -\\nmobile and well positioned to frighten someone. It would \\nnot have come as a surprise to Gregor if she had not come \\nin, since his position was preventing her from opening the \\nwindow immediately. But she not only did not step inside; \\nshe even retreated and shut the door. A stranger really could \\nhave concluded from this that Gregor had been lying in wait \\nfor her and wanted to bite her. Of course, Gregor imme -\\ndiately concealed himself under the couch, but he had to \\nwait until the noon meal before his sister returned, and she \\nseemed much less calm than usual. From this he realized \\nthat his appearance was still constantly intolerable to her \\n\\nThe Metamorphosis \\x180and must remain intolerable in future, and that she real -\\nly had to exert a lot of self-control not to run away from a \\nglimpse of only the small part of his body which stuck out \\nfrom under the couch. In order to spare her even this sight, \\none day he dragged the sheet on his back onto the couch \\n(this task took him four hours) and arranged it in such a \\nway that he was now completely concealed and his sister, \\neven if she bent down, could not see him. If this sheet was \\nnot necessary as far as she was concerned, then she could \\nremove it, for it was clear enough that Gregor could not de -\\nrive any pleasure from isolating himself away so completely. \\nBut she left the sheet just as it was, and Gregor believed he \\neven caught a look of gratitude when on one occasion he \\ncarefully lifted up the sheet a little with his head to check as \\nhis sister took stock of the new arrangement.\\nIn the first two weeks his parents could not bring \\nthemselves to visit him, and he often heard how they ful -\\nly acknowledged his sister’s present work; whereas, earlier \\nthey had often got annoyed at his sister because she had \\nseemed to them a somewhat useless young woman. Howev -\\ner, now both his father and his mother often waited in front \\nof Gregor’s door while his sister cleaned up inside, and as \\nsoon as she came out she had to explain in detail how things \\nlooked in the room, what Gregor had eaten, how he had be -\\nhaved this time, and whether perhaps a slight improvement \\nwas perceptible. In any event, his mother comparatively \\nsoon wanted to visit Gregor, but his father and his sister re -\\nstrained her, at first with reasons which Gregor listened to \\nvery attentively and which he completely endorsed. Later, \\n\\n\\x181 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.comhowever, they had to hold her back forcefully, and when \\nshe then cried ‘Let me go to Gregor. He’s my unlucky son! \\nDon’t you understand that I have to go to him?’ Gregor then \\nthought that perhaps it would be a good thing if his mother \\ncame in, not every day, of course, but maybe once a week. \\nShe understood everything much better than his sister, who \\nin spite of all her courage was still a child and, in the last \\nanalysis, had perhaps undertaken such a difficult task only \\nout of childish recklessness.\\nGregor’s wish to see his mother was soon realized. While \\nduring the day Gregor, out of consideration for his parents, \\ndid not want to show himself by the window, he couldn’t \\ncrawl around very much on the few square metres of the \\nfloor. He found it difficult to bear lying quietly during the \\nnight, and soon eating no longer gave him the slightest \\npleasure. So for diversion he acquired the habit of crawl -\\ning back and forth across the walls and ceiling. He was \\nespecially fond of hanging from the ceiling. The experience \\nwas quite different from lying on the floor. It was easier to \\nbreathe, a slight vibration went through his body, and in the \\nmidst of the almost happy amusement which Gregor found \\nup there, it could happen that, to his own surprise, he let go \\nand hit the floor. However, now he naturally controlled his \\nbody quite differently, and he did not injure himself in such \\na great fall. His sister noticed immediately the new amuse -\\nment which Gregor had found for himself (for as he crept \\naround he left behind here and there traces of his sticky \\nstuff), and so she got the idea of making Gregor’s creeping \\naround as easy as possible and thus of removing the furni -\\n\\nThe Metamorphosis \\x18\\x18ture which got in the way, especially the chest of drawers \\nand the writing desk.\\nBut she was in no position to do this by herself. She did \\nnot dare to ask her father to help, and the servant girl would \\ncertainly not have assisted her, for although this girl, about \\nsixteen years old, had courageously remained since the \\ndismissal of the previous cook, she had begged for the priv -\\nilege of being allowed to stay permanently confined to the \\nkitchen and of having to open the door only in answer to a \\nspecial summons. Thus, his sister had no other choice but \\nto involve his mother while his father was absent. His moth -\\ner approached Gregor’s room with cries of excited joy, but \\nshe fell silent at the door. Of course, his sister first checked \\nwhether everything in the room was in order. Only then \\ndid she let his mother walk in. In great haste Gregor had \\ndrawn the sheet down even further and wrinkled it more. \\nThe whole thing really looked just like a coverlet thrown \\ncarelessly over the couch. On this occasion, Gregor held \\nback from spying out from under the sheet. Thus, he re -\\nfrained from looking at his mother this time and was just \\nhappy that she had come. ‘Come on; he is not visible,’ said \\nhis sister, and evidently led his mother by the hand. Now \\nGregor listened as these two weak women shifted the still \\nheavy old chest of drawers from its position, and as his sis -\\nter constantly took on herself the greatest part of the work, \\nwithout listening to the warnings of his mother who was \\nafraid that she would strain herself. The work lasted a long \\ntime. After about a quarter of an hour had already gone by \\nhis mother said that it would be better if they left the chest \\n\\n\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.comof drawers where it was, because, in the first place, it was too \\nheavy: they would not be finished before his father’s arrival, \\nand with the chest of drawers in the middle of the room it \\nwould block all Gregor’s pathways, but, in the second place, \\nit might not be certain that Gregor would be pleased with \\nthe removal of the furniture. To her the reverse seemed to \\nbe true; the sight of the empty walls pierced her right to the \\nheart, and why should Gregor not feel the same, since he \\nhad been accustomed to the room furnishings for a long \\ntime and in an empty room would thus feel himself aban -\\ndoned.\\n‘And is it not the case,’ his mother concluded very qui -\\netly, almost whispering as if she wished to prevent Gregor, \\nwhose exact location she really didn’t know, from hearing \\neven the sound of her voice (for she was convinced that he \\ndid not understand her words), ‘and isn’t it a fact that by \\nremoving the furniture we’re showing that we’re giving up \\nall hope of an improvement and are leaving him to his own \\nresources without any consideration? I think it would be \\nbest if we tried to keep the room exactly in the condition in \\nwhich it was before, so that, when Gregor returns to us, he \\nfinds everything unchanged and can forget the intervening \\ntime all the more easily.’\\nAs he heard his mother’s words Gregor realized that the \\nlack of all immediate human contact, together with the mo -\\nnotonous life surrounded by the family over the course of \\nthese two months must have confused his understanding, \\nbecause otherwise he couldn’t explain to himself that he \\nin all seriousness could’ve been so keen to have his room \\n\\nThe Metamorphosis \\x18\\x18emptied. Was he really eager to let the warm room, com -\\nfortably furnished with pieces he had inherited, be turned \\ninto a cavern in which he would, of course, then be able to \\ncrawl about in all directions without disturbance, but at the \\nsame time with a quick and complete forgetting of his hu -\\nman past as well? Was he then at this point already on the \\nverge of forgetting and was it only the voice of his mother, \\nwhich he had not heard for along time, that had aroused \\nhim? Nothing was to be removed; everything must remain. \\nIn his condition he couldn’t function without the beneficial \\ninfluences of his furniture. And if the furniture prevented \\nhim from carrying out his senseless crawling about all over \\nthe place, then there was no harm in that, but rather a great \\nbenefit.\\nBut his sister unfortunately thought otherwise. She had \\ngrown accustomed, certainly not without justification, so \\nfar as the discussion of matters concerning Gregor was \\nconcerned, to act as an special expert with respect to their \\nparents, and so now the mother’s advice was for his sister \\nsufficient reason to insist on the removal, not only of the \\nchest of drawers and the writing desk, which were the only \\nitems she had thought about at first, but also of all the fur -\\nniture, with the exception of the indispensable couch. Of \\ncourse, it was not only childish defiance and her recent very \\nunexpected and hard won self-confidence which led her to \\nthis demand. She had also actually observed that Gregor \\nneeded a great deal of room to creep about; the furniture, \\non the other hand, as far as one could see, was not of the \\nslightest use.\\n\\n\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.comBut perhaps the enthusiastic sensibility of young women \\nof her age also played a role. This feeling sought release at \\nevery opportunity, and with it Grete now felt tempted to \\nwant to make Gregor’s situation even more terrifying, so \\nthat then she would be able to do even more for him than \\nnow. For surely no one except Grete would ever trust them -\\nselves to enter a room in which Gregor ruled the empty \\nwalls all by himself. And so she did not let herself be dis -\\nsuaded from her decision by her mother, who in this room \\nseemed uncertain of herself in her sheer agitation and soon \\nkept quiet, helping his sister with all her energy to get the \\nchest of drawers out of the room. Now, Gregor could still \\ndo without the chest of drawers if need be, but the writing \\ndesk really had to stay. And scarcely had the women left the \\nroom with the chest of drawers, groaning as they pushed \\nit, when Gregor stuck his head out from under the sofa to \\ntake a look how he could intervene cautiously and with as \\nmuch consideration as possible. But unfortunately it was his \\nmother who came back into the room first, while Grete had \\nher arms wrapped around the chest of drawers in the next \\nroom and was rocking it back and forth by herself, without \\nmoving it from its position. His mother was not used to the \\nsight of Gregor; he could have made her ill, and so, fright -\\nened, Gregor scurried backwards right to the other end of \\nthe sofa, but he could no longer prevent the sheet from mov -\\ning forward a little. That was enough to catch his mother’s \\nattention. She came to a halt, stood still for a moment, and \\nthen went back to Grete.\\nAlthough Gregor kept repeating to himself over and \\n\\nThe Metamorphosis \\x18\\x18over that really nothing unusual was going on, that only \\na few pieces of furniture were being rearranged, he soon \\nhad to admit to himself that the movements of the wom -\\nen to and fro, their quiet conversations, the scratching of \\nthe furniture on the floor affected him like a great swollen \\ncommotion on all sides, and, so firmly was he pulling in his \\nhead and legs and pressing his body into the floor, he had \\nto tell himself unequivocally that he wouldn’t be able to en -\\ndure all this much longer. They were cleaning out his room, \\ntaking away from him everything he cherished; they had \\nalready dragged out the chest of drawers in which the fret \\nsaw and other tools were kept, and they were now loosening \\nthe writing desk which was fixed tight to the floor, the desk \\non which he, as a business student, a school student, in -\\ndeed even as an elementary school student, had written out \\nhis assignments. At that moment he really didn’t have any \\nmore time to check the good intentions of the two women, \\nwhose existence he had in any case almost forgotten, be -\\ncause in their exhaustion they were working really silently, \\nand the heavy stumbling of their feet was the only sound to \\nbe heard.\\nAnd so he scuttled out (the women were just propping \\nthemselves up on the writing desk in the next room in or -\\nder to take a breather) changing the direction of his path \\nfour times. He really didn’t know what he should rescue \\nfirst. Then he saw hanging conspicuously on the wall, which \\nwas otherwise already empty, the picture of the woman \\ndressed in nothing but fur. He quickly scurried up over it \\nand pressed himself against the glass that held it in place \\n\\n\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.comand which made his hot abdomen feel good. At least this \\npicture, which Gregor at the moment completely concealed, \\nsurely no one would now take away. He twisted his head to -\\nwards the door of the living room to observe the women as \\nthey came back in.\\nThey had not allowed themselves very much rest and \\nwere coming back right away. Grete had placed her arm \\naround her mother and held her tightly. ‘So what shall we \\ntake now?’ said Grete and looked around her. Then her \\nglance crossed with Gregor’s from the wall. She kept her \\ncomposure only because her mother was there. She bent her \\nface towards her mother in order to prevent her from look -\\ning around, and said, although in a trembling voice and too \\nquickly, ‘Come, wouldn’t it be better to go back to the living \\nroom for just another moment?’ Grete’s purpose was clear \\nto Gregor: she wanted to bring his mother to a safe place \\nand then chase him down from the wall. Well, let her just \\nattempt that! He squatted on his picture and did not hand it \\nover. He would sooner spring into Grete’s face.\\nBut Grete’s words had immediately made the moth -\\ner very uneasy. She walked to the side, caught sight of the \\nenormous brown splotch on the flowered wallpaper, and, \\nbefore she became truly aware that what she was looking \\nat was Gregor, screamed out in a high pitched raw voice \\n‘Oh God, oh God’ and fell with outstretched arms, as if she \\nwas surrendering everything, down onto the couch and lay \\nthere motionless. ‘Gregor, you …,’ cried out his sister with \\na raised fist and an urgent glare. Since his transformation \\nthose were the first words which she had directed right at \\n\\nThe Metamorphosis \\x18\\x18him. She ran into the room next door to bring some spir -\\nits or other with which she could revive her mother from \\nher fainting spell. Gregor wanted to help as well (there was \\ntime enough to save the picture), but he was stuck fast on \\nthe glass and had to tear himself loose forcefully. Then he \\nalso scurried into the next room, as if he could give his sis -\\nter some advice, as in earlier times, but then he had to stand \\nthere idly behind her, while she rummaged about among \\nvarious small bottles. Still, she was frightened when she \\nturned around. A bottle fell onto the floor and shattered. \\nA splinter of glass wounded Gregor in the face, some cor -\\nrosive medicine or other dripped over him. Now, without \\nlingering any longer, Grete took as many small bottles as \\nshe could hold and ran with them into her mother. She \\nslammed the door shut with her foot. Gregor was now shut \\noff from his mother, who was perhaps near death, thanks \\nto him. He could not open the door, and he did not want to \\nchase away his sister who had to remain with her mother. At \\nthis point he had nothing to do but wait, and overwhelmed \\nwith self-reproach and worry, he began to creep and crawl \\nover everything: walls, furniture, and ceiling,. Finally, in \\nhis despair, as the entire room started to spin around him, \\nhe fell onto the middle of the large table.\\nA short time elapsed. Gregor lay there limply. All around \\nwas still. Perhaps that was a good sign. Then there was ring \\nat the door. The servant girl was naturally shut up in her \\nkitchen, and Grete must therefore go to open the door. The \\nfather had arrived. ‘What’s happened,’ were his first words. \\nGrete’s appearance had told him everything. Grete replied \\n\\n\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.comwith a dull voice; evidently she was pressing her face into \\nher father’s chest: ‘Mother fainted, but she’s getting better \\nnow. Gregor has broken loose.’ ‘Yes, I have expected that,’ \\nsaid his father, ‘I always told you that, but you women don’t \\nwant to listen.’\\nIt was clear to Gregor that his father had badly mis -\\nunderstood Grete’s short message and was assuming that \\nGregor had committed some violent crime or other. Thus, \\nGregor now had to find his father to calm him down, for he \\nhad neither the time nor the opportunity to clarify things \\nfor him. And so he rushed away to the door of his room and \\npushed himself against it, so that his father could see right \\naway as he entered from the hall that Gregor fully intended \\nto return at once to his room, that it was not necessary to \\ndrive him back, but that one only needed to open the door \\nand he would disappear immediately.\\nBut his father was not in the mood to observe such nice -\\nties. ‘Ah,’ he yelled as soon as he entered, with a tone as if he \\nwere all at once angry and pleased. Gregor pulled his head \\nback from the door and raised it in the direction of his fa -\\nther. He had not really pictured his father as he now stood \\nthere. Of course, what with his new style of creeping all \\naround, he had in the past while neglected to pay attention \\nto what was going on in the rest of the apartment, as he had \\ndone before, and really should have grasped the fact that \\nhe would encounter different conditions. Nevertheless, nev -\\nertheless, was that still his father? Was that the same man \\nwho had lain exhausted and buried in bed in earlier days \\nwhen Gregor was setting out on a business trip, who had re -\\n\\nThe Metamorphosis \\x180ceived him on the evenings of his return in a sleeping gown \\nand arm chair, totally incapable of standing up, who had \\nonly lifted his arm as a sign of happiness, and who in their \\nrare strolls together a few Sundays a year and on the impor -\\ntant holidays made his way slowly forwards between Gregor \\nand his mother (who themselves moved slowly), always a \\nbit more slowly than them, bundled up in his old coat, all \\nthe time setting down his walking stick carefully, and who, \\nwhen he had wanted to say something, almost always stood \\nstill and gathered his entourage around him?\\nBut now he was standing up really straight, dressed in a \\ntight fitting blue uniform with gold buttons, like the ones \\nservants wear in a banking company. Above the high stiff  \\ncollar of his jacket his firm double chin stuck out promi -\\nnently, beneath his bushy eyebrows the glance of his black \\neyes was freshly penetrating and alert, his otherwise di -\\nsheveled white hair was combed down into a carefully exact \\nshining part. He threw his cap, on which a gold monogram \\n(apparently the symbol of the bank) was affixed, in an arc \\nacross the entire room onto the sofa and moved, throwing \\nback the edge of the long coat of his uniform, with his hands \\nin his trouser pockets and a grim face, right up to Gregor.\\nHe really didn’t know what he had in mind, but he raised \\nhis foot uncommonly high anyway, and Gregor was aston -\\nished at the gigantic size of his sole of his boot. However, \\nhe did not linger on that point. For he knew from the first \\nday of his new life that as far as he was concerned his father \\nconsidered the greatest force the only appropriate response. \\nAnd so he scurried away from his father, stopped when his \\n\\n\\x181 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.comfather remained standing, and scampered forward again \\nwhen his father merely stirred. In this way they made their \\nway around the room repeatedly, without anything decisive \\ntaking place; indeed because of the slow pace it didn’t look \\nlike a chase. Gregor remained on the floor for the time be -\\ning, especially as he was afraid that his father could take a \\nflight up onto the wall or the ceiling as an act of real mal -\\nice. At any event Gregor had to tell himself that he couldn’t \\nkeep up this running around for a long time, because when -\\never his father took a single step, he had to go through an \\nenormous number of movements. Already he was starting \\nto suffer from a shortage of breath, just as in his earlier days \\nhis lungs had been quite unreliable. As he now staggered \\naround in this way in order to gather all his energies for \\nrunning, hardly keeping his eyes open, in his listlessness he \\nhad no notion at all of any escape other than by running and \\nhad almost already forgotten that the walls were available \\nto him, although they were obstructed by carefully carved \\nfurniture full of sharp points and spikes—at that moment \\nsomething or other thrown casually flew down close by and \\nrolled in front of him. It was an apple; immediately a second \\none flew after it. Gregor stood still in fright. Further flight \\nwas useless, for his father had decided to bombard him.\\nFrom the fruit bowl on the sideboard his father had filled \\nhis pockets, and now, without for the moment taking ac -\\ncurate aim, was throwing apple after apple. These small \\nred apples rolled as if electrified around on the floor and \\ncollided with each other. A weakly thrown apple grazed \\nGregor’s back but skidded off harmlessly. However anoth -\\n\\nThe Metamorphosis \\x18\\x18er thrown immediately after that one drove into Gregor’s \\nback really hard. Gregor wanted to drag himself off, as if \\nthe unexpected and incredible pain would go away if he \\nchanged his position. But he felt as if he was nailed in place \\nand lay stretched out completely confused in all his sens -\\nes. Only with his final glance did he notice how the door \\nof his room was pulled open and how, right in front of his \\nsister (who was yelling), his mother ran out in her under -\\ngarments, for his sister had undressed her in order to give \\nher some freedom to breathe in her fainting spell, and how \\nhis mother then ran up to his father, on the way her tied up \\nskirts one after the other slipped toward the floor, and how, \\ntripping over her skirts, she hurled herself onto his father \\nand, throwing her arms around him, in complete union \\nwith him—but at this moment Gregor’s powers of sight gave \\nway—as her hands reached to the back of his father’s head \\nand she begged him to spare Gregor’s life.\\n\\n\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.comIII\\nGregor’s serious wound, from which he suffered for over \\na month (since no one ventured to remove the apple, it \\nremained in his flesh as a visible reminder), seemed by it -\\nself to have reminded the father that, in spite of his present \\nunhappy and hateful appearance, Gregor was a member of \\nthe family, something one should not treat as an enemy, and \\nthat it was, on the contrary, a requirement of family duty to \\nsuppress one’s aversion and to endure—nothing else, just \\nendure. And if through his wound Gregor had now appar -\\nently lost for good his ability to move and for the time being \\nneeded many many minutes to crawl across this room, like \\nan aged invalid (so far as creeping up high was concerned, \\nthat was unimaginable), nevertheless for this worsening of \\nhis condition, in his opinion, he did get completely satisfac -\\ntory compensation, because every day towards evening the \\ndoor to the living room, which he was in the habit of keep -\\ning a sharp eye on even one or two hours beforehand, was \\nopened, so that he, lying down in the darkness of his room, \\ninvisible from the living room, could see the entire family \\nat the illuminated table and listen to their conversation, to \\na certain extent with their common permission, a situation \\nquite different from what happened before.\\nOf course, it was no longer the animated social inter -\\naction of former times, about which Gregor in small hotel \\n\\nThe Metamorphosis \\x18\\x18rooms had always thought about with a certain longing, \\nwhen, tired out, he had to throw himself in the damp bed -\\nclothes. For the most part what went on now was very quiet. \\nAfter the evening meal the father fell asleep quickly in his \\narm chair; the mother and sister talked guardedly to each \\nother in the stillness. Bent far over, the mother sewed fine \\nundergarments for a fashion shop. The sister, who had taken \\non a job as a salesgirl, in the evening studied stenography \\nand French, so as perhaps later to obtain a better position. \\nSometimes the father woke up and, as if he was quite ig -\\nnorant that he had been asleep, said to the mother ‘How \\nlong you have been sewing today!’ and went right back to \\nsleep, while the mother and the sister smiled tiredly to each \\nother.\\nWith a sort of stubbornness the father refused to take \\noff his servant’s uniform even at home, and while his sleep -\\ning gown hung unused on the coat hook, the father dozed \\ncompletely dressed in his place, as if he was always ready for \\nhis responsibility and even here was waiting for the voice of \\nhis superior. As result, in spite of all the care of the mother \\nand sister, his uniform, which even at the start was not new, \\ngrew dirty, and Gregor looked, often for the entire evening, \\nat this clothing, with stains all over it and with its gold but -\\ntons always polished, in which the old man, although very \\nuncomfortable, slept peacefully nonetheless.\\nAs soon as the clock struck ten, the mother tried encour -\\naging the father gently to wake up and then persuading him \\nto go to bed, on the ground that he couldn’t get a proper \\nsleep here and the father, who had to report for service at six \\n\\n\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.como’clock, really needed a good sleep. But in his stubbornness, \\nwhich had gripped him since he had become a servant, he \\ninsisted always on staying even longer by the table, although \\nhe regularly fell asleep and then could only be prevailed \\nupon with the greatest difficulty to trade his chair for the \\nbed. No matter how much the mother and sister might at \\nthat point work on him with small admonitions, for a quar -\\nter of an hour he would remain shaking his head slowly, his \\neyes closed, without standing up. The mother would pull \\nhim by the sleeve and speak flattering words into his ear; \\nthe sister would leave her work to help her mother, but that \\nwould not have the desired effect on the father. He would \\nsettle himself even more deeply in his arm chair. Only when \\nthe two women grabbed him under the armpits would he \\nthrow his eyes open, look back and forth at the mother and \\nsister, and habitually say ‘This is a life. This is the peace and \\nquiet of my old age.’ And propped up by both women, he \\nwould heave himself up, elaborately, as if for him it was the \\ngreatest travail, allow himself to be led to the door by the \\nwomen, wave them away there, and proceed on his own \\nfrom there, while the mother quickly threw down her sew -\\ning implements and the sister her pen in order to run after \\nthe father and help him some more.\\nIn this overworked and exhausted family who had time \\nto worry any longer about Gregor more than was absolutely \\nnecessary? The household was constantly getting small -\\ner. The servant girl was now let go. A huge bony cleaning \\nwoman with white hair flapping all over her head came in \\nthe morning and the evening to do the heaviest work. The \\n\\nThe Metamorphosis \\x18\\x18mother took care of everything else in addition to her con -\\nsiderable sewing work. It even happened that various pieces \\nof family jewelry, which previously the mother and sister \\nhad been overjoyed to wear on social and festive occasions, \\nwere sold, as Gregor found out in the evening from the \\ngeneral discussion of the prices they had fetched. But the \\ngreatest complaint was always that they could not leave this \\napartment, which was too big for their present means, since \\nit was impossible to imagine how Gregor might be moved. \\nBut Gregor fully recognized that it was not just consider -\\nation for him which was preventing a move (for he could \\nhave been transported easily in a suitable box with a few \\nair holes); the main thing holding the family back from \\na change in living quarters was far more their complete \\nhopelessness and the idea that they had been struck by a \\nmisfortune like no one else in their entire circle of relatives \\nand acquaintances.\\nWhat the world demands of poor people they now car -\\nried out to an extreme degree. The father bought breakfast \\nto the petty officials at the bank, the mother sacrificed her -\\nself for the undergarments of strangers, the sister behind \\nher desk was at the beck and call of customers, but the fam -\\nily’s energies did not extend any further. And the wound \\nin his back began to pain Gregor all over again, when now \\nmother and sister, after they had escorted the father to bed, \\ncame back, let their work lie, moved close together, and sat \\ncheek to cheek and when his mother would now say, point -\\ning to Gregor’s room, ‘Close the door, Grete,’ and when \\nGregor was again in the darkness, while close by the women \\n\\n\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.commingled their tears or, quite dry eyed, stared at the table.\\nGregor spent his nights and days with hardly any sleep. \\nSometimes he thought that the next time the door opened \\nhe would take over the family arrangements just as he had \\nearlier. In his imagination appeared again, after a long time, \\nhis employer and supervisor and the apprentices, the exces -\\nsively gormless custodian, two or three friends from other \\nbusinesses, a chambermaid from a hotel in the provinces, a \\nloving fleeting memory, a female cashier from a hat shop, \\nwhom he had seriously, but too slowly courted—they all ap -\\npeared mixed in with strangers or people he had already \\nforgotten, but instead of helping him and his family, they \\nwere all unapproachable, and he was happy to see them dis -\\nappear.\\nBut then he was in no mood to worry about his fami -\\nly. He was filled with sheer anger over the wretched care \\nhe was getting, even though he couldn’t imagine anything \\nfor which he might have an appetite. Still, he made plans \\nabout how he could take from the larder what he at all ac -\\ncount deserved, even if he wasn’t hungry. Without thinking \\nany more about how one might be able to give Gregor spe -\\ncial pleasure, the sister now kicked some food or other very \\nquickly into his room in the morning and at noon, before \\nshe ran off to her shop, and in the evening, quite indiffer -\\nent about whether the food had perhaps only been tasted or, \\nwhat happened most frequently, remained entirely undis -\\nturbed, she whisked it out with one sweep of her broom. The \\ntask of cleaning his room, which she now always carried out \\nin the evening, could not be done any more quickly. Streaks \\n\\nThe Metamorphosis \\x18\\x18of dirt ran along the walls; here and there lay tangles of dust \\nand garbage. At first, when his sister arrived, Gregor posi -\\ntioned himself in a particularly filthy corner in order with \\nthis posture to make something of a protest. But he could \\nhave well stayed there for weeks without his sister’s chang -\\ning her ways. Indeed, she perceived the dirt as much as he \\ndid, but she had decided just to let it stay.\\nIn this business, with a touchiness which was quite new \\nto her and which had generally taken over the entire fam -\\nily, she kept watch to see that the cleaning of Gregor’s room \\nremained reserved for her. Once his mother had undertak -\\nen a major cleaning of Gregor’s room, which she had only \\ncompleted successfully after using a few buckets of water. \\nBut the extensive dampness made Gregor sick and he lay \\nsupine, embittered and immobile on the couch. However, \\nthe mother’s punishment was not delayed for long. For in \\nthe evening the sister had hardly observed the change in \\nGregor’s room before she ran into the living room might -\\nily offended and, in spite of her mother’s hand lifted high in \\nentreaty, broke out in a fit of crying. Her parents (the father \\nhad, of course, woken up with a start in his arm chair) at \\nfirst looked at her astonished and helpless; until they start -\\ned to get agitated. Turning to his right, the father heaped \\nreproaches on the mother that she was not to take over the \\ncleaning of Gregor’s room from the sister and, turning to \\nhis left, he shouted at the sister that she would no longer \\nbe allowed to clean Gregor’s room ever again, while the \\nmother tried to pull the father, beside himself in his excite -\\nment, into the bed room; the sister, shaken by her crying fit, \\n\\n\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.compounded on the table with her tiny fists, and Gregor hissed \\nat all this, angry that no one thought about shutting the \\ndoor and sparing him the sight of this commotion.\\nBut even when the sister, exhausted from her daily work, \\nhad grown tired of caring for Gregor as she had before, \\neven then the mother did not have to come at all on her be -\\nhalf. And Gregor did not have to be neglected. For now the \\ncleaning woman was there. This old widow, who in her long \\nlife must have managed to survive the worst with the help \\nof her bony frame, had no real horror of Gregor. Without \\nbeing in the least curious, she had once by chance opened \\nGregor’s door. At the sight of Gregor, who, totally surprised, \\nbegan to scamper here and there, although no one was \\nchasing him, she remained standing with her hands folded \\nacross her stomach staring at him. Since then she did not \\nfail to open the door furtively a little every morning and \\nevening to look in on Gregor. At first, she also called him to \\nher with words which she presumably thought were friend -\\nly, like ‘Come here for a bit, old dung beetle!’ or ‘Hey, look \\nat the old dung beetle!’ Addressed in such a manner, Gregor \\nanswered nothing, but remained motionless in his place, \\nas if the door had not been opened at all. If only, instead \\nof allowing this cleaning woman to disturb him uselessly \\nwhenever she felt like it, they had instead given her orders \\nto clean up his room every day! One day in the early morn -\\ning (a hard downpour, perhaps already a sign of the coming \\nspring, struck the window panes) when the cleaning woman \\nstarted up once again with her usual conversation, Gregor \\nwas so bitter that he turned towards her, as if for an attack, \\n\\nThe Metamorphosis \\x180although slowly and weakly. But instead of being afraid of \\nhim, the cleaning woman merely lifted up a chair standing \\nclose by the door and, as she stood there with her mouth \\nwide open, her intention was clear: she would close her \\nmouth only when the chair in her hand had been thrown \\ndown on Gregor’s back. ‘This goes no further, all right?’ \\nshe asked, as Gregor turned himself around again, and she \\nplaced the chair calmly back in the corner.\\nGregor ate hardly anything any more. Only when he \\nchanced to move past the food which had been prepared \\ndid he, as a game, take a bit into his mouth, hold it there for \\nhours, and generally spit it out again. At first he thought it \\nmight be his sadness over the condition of his room which \\nkept him from eating, but he very soon became reconciled \\nto the alterations in his room. People had grown accus -\\ntomed to put into storage in his room things which they \\ncouldn’t put anywhere else, and at this point there were \\nmany such things, now that they had rented one room of \\nthe apartment to three lodgers. These solemn gentlemen (all \\nthree had full beards, as Gregor once found out through a \\ncrack in the door) were meticulously intent on tidiness, not \\nonly in their own room but (since they had now rented a \\nroom here) in the entire household, and particularly in the \\nkitchen. They simply did not tolerate any useless or shoddy \\nstuff. Moreover, for the most part they had brought with \\nthem their own pieces of furniture. Thus, many items had \\nbecome superfluous, and these were not really things one \\ncould sell or things people wanted to throw out. All these \\nitems ended up in Gregor’s room, even the box of ashes and \\n\\n\\x181 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.comthe garbage pail from the kitchen. The cleaning woman, \\nalways in a hurry, simply flung anything that was mo -\\nmentarily useless into Gregor’s room. Fortunately Gregor \\ngenerally saw only the relevant object and the hand which \\nheld it. The cleaning woman perhaps was intending, when \\ntime and opportunity allowed, to take the stuff out again or \\nto throw everything out all at once, but in fact the things re -\\nmained lying there, wherever they had ended up at the first \\nthrow, unless Gregor squirmed his way through the accu -\\nmulation of junk and moved it. At first he was forced to do \\nthis because otherwise there was no room for him to creep \\naround, but later he did it with a with a growing pleasure, \\nalthough after such movements, tired to death and feeling \\nwretched, he didn’t budge for hours.\\nBecause the lodgers sometimes also took their evening \\nmeal at home in the common living room, the door to the \\nliving room stayed shut on many evenings. But Gregor had \\nno trouble at all going without the open door. Already on \\nmany evenings when it was open he had not availed himself \\nof it, but, without the family noticing, was stretched out in \\nthe darkest corner of his room. However, once the cleaning \\nwoman had left the door to the living room slightly ajar, and \\nit remained open even when the lodgers came in in the eve -\\nning and the lights were put on. They sat down at the head \\nof the table, where in earlier days the mother, the father, and \\nGregor had eaten, unfolded their serviettes, and picked up \\ntheir knives and forks. The mother immediately appeared \\nin the door with a dish of meat and right behind her the sis -\\nter with a dish piled high with potatoes. The food gave off a \\n\\nThe Metamorphosis \\x18\\x18lot of steam. The gentlemen lodgers bent over the plate set \\nbefore them, as if they wanted to check it before eating, and \\nin fact the one who sat in the middle (for the other two he \\nseemed to serve as the authority) cut off a piece of meat still \\non the plate obviously to establish whether it was sufficient -\\nly tender and whether or not something should be shipped \\nback to the kitchen. He was satisfied, and mother and sister, \\nwho had looked on in suspense, began to breathe easily and \\nto smile.\\nThe family itself ate in the kitchen. In spite of that, be -\\nfore the father went into the kitchen, he came into the room \\nand with a single bow, cap in hand, made a tour of the table. \\nThe lodgers rose up collectively and murmured something \\nin their beards. Then, when they were alone, they ate almost \\nin complete silence. It seemed odd to Gregor that out of all \\nthe many different sorts of sounds of eating, what was al -\\nways audible was their chewing teeth, as if by that Gregor \\nshould be shown that people needed their teeth to eat and \\nthat nothing could be done even with the most handsome \\ntoothless jawbone. ‘I really do have an appetite,’ Gregor said \\nto himself sorrowfully, ‘but not for these things. How these \\nlodgers stuff themselves, and I am dying.’\\nOn this very evening (Gregor didn’t remember hear -\\ning the violin all through this period) it sounded from the \\nkitchen. The lodgers had already ended their night meal, the \\nmiddle one had pulled out a newspaper and had given each \\nof the other two a page, and they were now leaning back, \\nreading and smoking. When the violin started playing, they \\nbecame attentive, got up, and went on tiptoe to the hall door, \\n\\n\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.comat which they remained standing pressed up against one \\nanother. They must have been audible from the kitchen, be -\\ncause the father called out ‘Perhaps the gentlemen don’t like \\nthe playing? It can be stopped at once.’ ‘On the contrary,’ \\nstated the lodger in the middle, ‘might the young woman \\nnot come into us and play in the room here where it is re -\\nally much more comfortable and cheerful?’ ‘Oh, thank you,’ \\ncried out the father, as if he were the one playing the violin. \\nThe men stepped back into the room and waited. Soon the \\nfather came with the music stand, the mother with the sheet \\nmusic, and the sister with the violin. The sister calmly pre -\\npared everything for the recital. The parents, who had never \\npreviously rented a room and therefore exaggerated their \\npoliteness to the lodgers, dared not sit on their own chairs. \\nThe father leaned against the door, his right hand stuck be -\\ntween two buttons of his buttoned up uniform. The mother, \\nhowever, accepted a chair offered by one lodger. Since she \\nleft the chair sit where the gentleman had chanced to put it, \\nshe sat to one side in a corner.\\nThe sister began to play. The father and mother, followed \\nattentively, one on each side, the movements of her hands. \\nAttracted by the playing, Gregor had ventured to advance \\na little further forward and his head was already in the liv -\\ning room. He scarcely wondered about the fact that recently \\nhe had had so little consideration for the others; earlier this \\nconsideration had been something he was proud of. And for \\nthat very reason he would’ve had at this moment more rea -\\nson to hide away, because as a result of the dust which lay \\nall over his room and flew around with the slightest move -\\n\\nThe Metamorphosis \\x18\\x18ment, he was totally covered in dirt. On his back and his \\nsides he carted around with him dust, threads, hair, and \\nremnants of food. His indifference to everything was much \\ntoo great for him to lie on his back and scour himself on the \\ncarpet, as he often had done earlier during the day. In spite \\nof his condition he had no timidity about inching forward a \\nbit on the spotless floor of the living room.\\nIn any case, no one paid him any attention. The fam -\\nily was all caught up in the violin playing. The lodgers, by \\ncontrast, who for the moment had placed themselves, their \\nhands in their trouser pockets, behind the music stand \\nmuch too close to the sister, so that they could all see the \\nsheet music, something that must certainly bother the sis -\\nter, soon drew back to the window conversing in low voices \\nwith bowed heads, where they then remained, worriedly \\nobserved by the father. It now seemed really clear that, hav -\\ning assumed they were to hear a beautiful or entertaining \\nviolin recital, they were disappointed, and were allowing \\ntheir peace and quiet to be disturbed only out of politeness. \\nThe way in which they all blew the smoke from their cigars \\nout of their noses and mouths in particular led one to con -\\nclude that they were very irritated. And yet his sister was \\nplaying so beautifully. Her face was turned to the side, her \\ngaze followed the score intently and sadly. Gregor crept for -\\nward still a little further and kept his head close against the \\nfloor in order to be able to catch her gaze if possible. Was he \\nan animal that music so seized him? For him it was as if the \\nway to the unknown nourishment he craved was revealing \\nitself to him. He was determined to press forward right to \\n\\n\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.comhis sister, to tug at her dress and to indicate to her in this \\nway that she might still come with her violin into his room, \\nbecause here no one valued the recital as he wanted to value \\nit. He did not wish to let her go from his room any more, \\nat least not as long as he lived. His frightening appearance \\nwould for the first time become useful for him. He want -\\ned to be at all the doors of his room simultaneously and \\nsnarl back at the attackers. However, his sister should not \\nbe compelled but would remain with him voluntarily; she \\nwould sit next to him on the sofa, bend down her ear to him, \\nand he would then confide in her that he firmly intended \\nto send her to the conservatory and that, if his misfortune \\nhad not arrived in the interim, he would have declared all \\nthis last Christmas (had Christmas really already come and \\ngone?), and would have brooked no argument. After this \\nexplanation his sister would break out in tears of emotion, \\nand Gregor would lift himself up to her armpit and kiss her \\nthroat, which she, from the time she started going to work, \\nhad left exposed without a band or a collar.\\n‘Mr. Samsa,’ called out the middle lodger to the father, \\nand pointed his index finger, without uttering a further \\nword, at Gregor as he was moving slowly forward. The vio -\\nlin fell silent. The middle lodger smiled, first shaking his \\nhead once at his friends, and then looked down at Gregor \\nonce more. Rather than driving Gregor back again, the fa -\\nther seemed to consider it of prime importance to calm \\ndown the lodgers, although they were not at all upset and \\nGregor seemed to entertain them more than the violin re -\\ncital. The father hurried over to them and with outstretched \\n\\nThe Metamorphosis \\x18\\x18arms tried to push them into their own room and simulta -\\nneously to block their view of Gregor with his own body. \\nAt this point they became really somewhat irritated, al -\\nthough one no longer knew whether that was because of the \\nfather’s behaviour or because of knowledge they had just ac -\\nquired that they had had, without knowing it, a neighbour \\nlike Gregor. They demanded explanations from his father, \\nraised their arms to make their points, tugged agitatedly \\nat their beards, and moved back towards their room quite \\nslowly. In the meantime, the isolation which had suddenly \\nfallen upon his sister after the sudden breaking off of the \\nrecital had overwhelmed her. She had held onto the violin \\nand bow in her limp hands for a little while and had contin -\\nued to look at the sheet music as if she was still playing. All \\nat once she pulled herself together, placed the instrument \\nin her mother’s lap (the mother was still sitting in her chair \\nhaving trouble breathing and with her lungs labouring) and \\nhad run into the next room, which the lodgers, pressured \\nby the father, were already approaching more rapidly. One \\ncould observe how under the sister’s practiced hands the \\nsheets and pillows on the beds were thrown on high and \\narranged. Even before the lodgers had reached the room, \\nshe was finished fixing the beds and was slipping out. The \\nfather seemed so gripped once again with his stubbornness \\nthat he forgot about the respect which he always owed to \\nhis renters. He pressed on and on, until at the door of the \\nroom the middle gentleman stamped loudly with his foot \\nand thus brought the father to a standstill. ‘I hereby de -\\nclare,’ the middle lodger said, raising his hand and casting \\n\\n\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.comhis glance both on the mother and the sister, ‘that consider -\\ning the disgraceful conditions prevailing in this apartment \\nand family,’ with this he spat decisively on the floor, ‘I im -\\nmediately cancel my room. I will, of course, pay nothing \\nat all for the days which I have lived here; on the contrary \\nI shall think about whether or not I will initiate some sort \\nof action against you, something which—believe me— will \\nbe very easy to establish.’ He fell silent and looked directly \\nin front of him, as if he was waiting for something. In fact, \\nhis two friends immediately joined in with their opinions, \\n‘We also give immediate notice.’ At that he seized the door \\nhandle, banged the door shut, and locked it.\\nThe father groped his way tottering to his chair and let \\nhimself fall in it. It looked as if he was stretching out for his \\nusual evening snooze, but the heavy nodding of his head \\n(which looked as if it was without support) showed that he \\nwas not sleeping at all. Gregor had lain motionless the entire \\ntime in the spot where the lodgers had caught him. Disap -\\npointment with the collapse of his plan and perhaps also \\nhis weakness brought on his severe hunger made it impos -\\nsible for him to move. He was certainly afraid that a general \\ndisaster would break over him at any moment, and he wait -\\ned. He was not even startled when the violin fell from the \\nmother’s lap, out from under her trembling fingers, and \\ngave off a reverberating tone.\\n‘My dear parents,’ said the sister banging her hand on \\nthe table by way of an introduction, ‘things cannot go on \\nany longer in this way. Maybe if you don’t understand that, \\nwell, I do. I will not utter my brother’s name in front of this \\n\\nThe Metamorphosis \\x18\\x18monster, and thus I say only that we must try to get rid of \\nit. We have tried what is humanly possible to take care of it \\nand to be patient. I believe that no one can criticize us in the \\nslightest.’ ‘She is right in a thousand ways,’ said the father \\nto himself. The mother, who was still incapable of breath -\\ning properly, began to cough numbly with her hand held up \\nover her mouth and a manic expression in her eyes.\\nThe sister hurried over to her mother and held her fore -\\nhead. The sister’s words seemed to have led the father to \\ncertain reflections. He sat upright, played with his uniform \\nhat among the plates, which still lay on the table from the \\nlodgers’ evening meal, and looked now and then at the mo -\\ntionless Gregor.\\n‘We must try to get rid of it,’ the sister now said decisively \\nto the father, for the mother, in her coughing fit, wasn’t lis -\\ntening to anything, ‘it is killing you both. I see it coming. \\nWhen people have to work as hard as we all do, they can -\\nnot also tolerate this endless torment at home. I just can’t \\ngo on any more.’ And she broke out into such a crying fit \\nthat her tears flowed out down onto her mother’s face. She \\nwiped them off her mother with mechanical motions of her \\nhands.\\n‘Child,’ said the father sympathetically and with obvious \\nappreciation, ‘then what should we do?’\\nThe sister only shrugged her shoulders as a sign of the \\nperplexity which, in contrast to her previous confidence, \\nhad come over her while she was crying.\\n‘If only he understood us,’ said the father in a semi-ques -\\ntioning tone. The sister, in the midst of her sobbing, shook \\n\\n\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.comher hand energetically as a sign that there was no point \\nthinking of that.\\n‘If he only understood us,’ repeated the father and by \\nshutting his eyes he absorbed the sister’s conviction of the \\nimpossibility of this point, ‘then perhaps some compromise \\nwould be possible with him. But as it is …’\\n‘It must be gotten rid of,’ cried the sister; ‘That is the only \\nway, father. You must try to get rid of the idea that this is \\nGregor. The fact that we have believed for so long, that is \\ntruly our real misfortune. But how can it be Gregor? If it \\nwere Gregor, he would have long ago realized that a com -\\nmunal life among human beings is not possible with such \\nan animal and would have gone away voluntarily. Then we \\nwould not have a brother, but we could go on living and \\nhonour his memory. But this animal plagues us. It drives \\naway the lodgers, will obviously take over the entire apart -\\nment, and leave us to spend the night in the alley. Just look, \\nfather,’ she suddenly cried out, ‘he’s already starting up \\nagain.’ With a fright which was totally incomprehensible to \\nGregor, the sister even left the mother, pushed herself away \\nfrom her chair, as if she would sooner sacrifice her mother \\nthan remain in Gregor’s vicinity, and rushed behind her fa -\\nther who, excited merely by her behaviour, also stood up \\nand half raised his arms in front of the sister as though to \\nprotect her.\\nBut Gregor did not have any notion of wishing to cre -\\nate problems for anyone and certainly not for his sister. He \\nhad just started to turn himself around in order to creep \\nback into his room, quite a startling sight, since, as a result \\n\\nThe Metamorphosis \\x180of his suffering condition, he had to guide himself through \\nthe difficulty of turning around with his head, in this pro -\\ncess lifting and banging it against the floor several times. \\nHe paused and looked around. His good intentions seem \\nto have been recognized. The fright had only lasted for a \\nmoment. Now they looked at him in silence and sorrow. \\nHis mother lay in her chair, with her legs stretched out and \\npressed together; her eyes were almost shut from weariness. \\nThe father and sister sat next to one another. The sister had \\nset her hands around the father’s neck.\\n‘ Now perhaps I can actually turn myself around,’ \\nthought Gregor and began the task again. He couldn’t stop \\npuffing at the effort and had to rest now and then.\\nBesides no on was urging him on. It was all left to him \\non his own. When he had completed turning around, he \\nimmediately began to wander straight back. He was aston -\\nished at the great distance which separated him from his \\nroom and did not understand in the least how in his weak -\\nness he had covered the same distance a short time before, \\nalmost without noticing it. Constantly intent only on creep -\\ning along quickly, he hardly paid any attention to the fact \\nthat no word or cry from his family interrupted him.\\nOnly when he was already in the door did he turn his \\nhead, not completely, because he felt his neck growing \\nstiff. At any rate he still saw that behind him nothing had \\nchanged. Only the sister was standing up. His last glimpse \\nbrushed over the mother who was now completely asleep. \\nHardly was he inside his room when the door was pushed \\nshut very quickly, bolted fast, and barred. Gregor was star -\\n\\n\\x181 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.comtled by the sudden commotion behind him, so much so that \\nhis little limbs bent double under him. It was his sister who \\nhad been in such a hurry. She had stood up right away, had \\nwaited, and had then sprung forward nimbly. Gregor had \\nnot heard anything of her approach. She cried out ‘Finally!’ \\nto her parents, as she turned the key in the lock.\\n‘What now?’ Gregor asked himself and looked around \\nhim in the darkness. He soon made the discovery that he \\ncould no longer move at all. He was not surprised at that. \\nOn the contrary, it struck him as unnatural that he had re -\\nally been able up to this point to move around with these \\nthin little legs. Besides he felt relatively content. True, he \\nhad pains throughout his entire body, but it seemed to him \\nthat they were gradually becoming weaker and weaker and \\nwould finally go away completely. The rotten apple in his \\nback and the inflamed surrounding area, entirely covered \\nwith white dust, he hardly noticed. He remembered his \\nfamily with deep feeling and love. In this business, his own \\nthought that he had to disappear was, if possible, even more \\ndecisive than his sister’s. He remained in this state of empty \\nand peaceful reflection until the tower clock struck three \\no’clock in the morning. From the window he witnessed the \\nbeginning of the general dawning outside. Then without \\nwilling it, his head sank all the way down, and from his nos -\\ntrils flowed out weakly out his last breath.\\nEarly in the morning the cleaning woman came. In her \\nsheer energy and haste she banged all the doors (in pre -\\ncisely the way people had already asked her to avoid), so \\nmuch so that once she arrived a quiet sleep was no longer \\n\\nThe Metamorphosis \\x18\\x18possible anywhere in the entire apartment. In her custom -\\narily brief visit to Gregor she at first found nothing special. \\nShe thought he lay so immobile there intending to play the \\noffended party. She gave him credit for as complete an un -\\nderstanding as possible. Because she happened to hold the \\nlong broom in her hand, she tried to tickle Gregor with it \\nfrom the door. When that was quite unsuccessful, she be -\\ncame irritated and poked Gregor a little, and only when she \\nhad shoved him from his place without any resistance did \\nshe become attentive. When she quickly realized the true \\nstate of affairs, her eyes grew large, she whistled to herself, \\nbut didn’t restrain herself for long. She pulled open the door \\nof the bedroom and yelled in a loud voice into the darkness, \\n‘Come and look. It’s kicked the bucket. It’s lying there, to -\\ntally snuffed!’\\nThe Samsa married couple sat upright in their marriage \\nbed and had to get over their fright at the cleaning woman \\nbefore they managed to grasp her message. But then Mr. \\nand Mrs. Samsa climbed very quickly out of bed, one on \\neither side. Mr. Samsa threw the bedspread over his shoul -\\nders, Mrs. Samsa came out only in her night-shirt, and like \\nthis they stepped into Gregor’s room. Meanwhile the door \\nof the living room (in which Grete had slept since the lodg -\\ners had arrived on the scene) had also opened. She was fully \\nclothed, as if she had not slept at all; her white face also \\nseem to indicate that. ‘Dead?’ said Mrs. Samsa and looked \\nquestioningly at the cleaning woman, although she could \\ncheck everything on her own and even understand without \\na check. ‘I should say so,’ said the cleaning woman and, by \\n\\n\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.comway of proof, poked Gregor’s body with the broom a con -\\nsiderable distance more to the side. Mrs. Samsa made a \\nmovement as if she wished to restrain the broom, but didn’t \\ndo it. ‘Well,’ said Mr. Samsa, ‘now we can give thanks to \\nGod.’ He crossed himself, and the three women followed \\nhis example.\\nGrete, who did not take her eyes off the corpse, said, \\n‘Look how thin he was. He had eaten nothing for such a \\nlong time. The meals which came in here came out again \\nexactly the same.’ In fact, Gregor’s body was completely flat \\nand dry. That was apparent really for the first time, now that \\nhe was no longer raised on his small limbs and, moreover, \\nnow that nothing else distracted one’s gaze.\\n‘Grete, come into us for a moment,’ said Mrs. Samsa with \\na melancholy smile, and Grete went, not without looking \\nback at the corpse, behind her parents into the bed room. \\nThe cleaning woman shut the door and opened the window \\nwide. In spite of the early morning, the fresh air was partly \\ntinged with warmth. It was already the end of March.\\nThe three lodgers stepped out of their room and looked \\naround for their breakfast, astonished that they had been \\nforgotten. ‘Where is the breakfast?’ asked the middle one of \\nthe gentlemen grumpily to the cleaning woman. However, \\nshe laid her finger to her lips and then quickly and silently \\nindicated to the lodgers that they could come into Gregor’s \\nroom. So they came and stood around Gregor’s corpse, their \\nhands in the pockets of their somewhat worn jackets, in the \\nroom, which was already quite bright.\\nThen the door of the bed room opened, and Mr. Samsa \\n\\nThe Metamorphosis \\x18\\x18appeared in his uniform, with his wife on one arm and his \\ndaughter on the other. All were a little tear stained. Now \\nand then Grete pressed her face onto her father’s arm.\\n‘Get out of my apartment immediately,’ said Mr. Samsa \\nand pulled open the door, without letting go of the women. \\n‘What do you mean?’ said the middle lodger, somewhat dis -\\nmayed and with a sugary smile. The two others kept their \\nhands behind them and constantly rubbed them against \\neach other, as if in joyful anticipation of a great squabble \\nwhich must end up in their favour. ‘I mean exactly what I \\nsay,’ replied Mr. Samsa and went directly with his two fe -\\nmale companions up to the lodger. The latter at first stood \\nthere motionless and looked at the floor, as if matters were \\narranging themselves in a new way in his head. ‘All right, \\nthen we’ll go,’ he said and looked up at Mr. Samsa as if, \\nsuddenly overcome by humility, he was asking fresh per -\\nmission for this decision. Mr. Samsa merely nodded to him \\nrepeatedly with his eyes open wide.\\nFollowing that, the lodger actually went immediately \\nwith long strides into the hall. His two friends had already \\nbeen listening for a while with their hands quite still, and \\nnow they hopped smartly after him, as if afraid that Mr. \\nSamsa could step into the hall ahead of them and disturb \\ntheir reunion with their leader. In the hall all three of them \\ntook their hats from the coat rack, pulled their canes from \\nthe cane holder, bowed silently, and left the apartment. In \\nwhat turned out to be an entirely groundless mistrust, Mr. \\nSamsa stepped with the two women out onto the landing, \\nleaned against the railing, and looked down as the three \\n\\n\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.comlodgers slowly but steadily made their way down the long \\nstaircase, disappeared on each floor in a certain turn of the \\nstairwell and in a few seconds came out again. The deep -\\ner they proceeded, the more the Samsa family lost interest \\nin them, and when a butcher with a tray on his head come \\nto meet them and then with a proud bearing ascended the \\nstairs high above them, Mr. Samsa., together with the wom -\\nen, left the banister, and they all returned, as if relieved, \\nback into their apartment.\\nThey decided to pass that day resting and going for a \\nstroll. Not only had they earned this break from work, but \\nthere was no question that they really needed it. And so they \\nsat down at the table and wrote three letters of apology: Mr. \\nSamsa to his supervisor, Mrs. Samsa to her client, and Grete \\nto her proprietor. During the writing the cleaning woman \\ncame in to say that she was going off, for her morning work \\nwas finished. The three people writing at first merely nod -\\nded, without glancing up. Only when the cleaning woman \\nwas still unwilling to depart, did they look up angrily. ‘Well?’ \\nasked Mr. Samsa. The cleaning woman stood smiling in the \\ndoorway, as if she had a great stroke of luck to report to the \\nfamily but would only do it if she was asked directly. The \\nalmost upright small ostrich feather in her hat, which had \\nirritated Mr. Samsa during her entire service, swayed light -\\nly in all directions. ‘All right then, what do you really want?’ \\nasked Mrs. Samsa, whom the cleaning lady still usually re -\\nspected. ‘Well,’ answered the cleaning woman (smiling so \\nhappily she couldn’t go on speaking right away), ‘about how \\nthat rubbish from the next room should be thrown out, you \\n\\nThe Metamorphosis \\x18\\x18mustn’t worry about it. It’s all taken care of.’ Mrs. Samsa \\nand Grete bent down to their letters, as though they wanted \\nto go on writing; Mr. Samsa, who noticed that the cleaning \\nwoman wanted to start describing everything in detail, de -\\ncisively prevented her with an outstretched hand. But since \\nshe was not allowed to explain, she remembered the great \\nhurry she was in, and called out, clearly insulted, ‘Ta ta, \\neveryone,’ turned around furiously and left the apartment \\nwith a fearful slamming of the door.\\n‘This evening she’ll be let go,’ said Mr. Samsa, but he got \\nno answer from either his wife or from his daughter, be -\\ncause the cleaning woman seemed to have upset once again \\nthe tranquillity they had just attained. They got up, went to \\nthe window and remained there, with their arms about each \\nother. Mr. Samsa turned around in his chair in their direc -\\ntion and observed them quietly for a while. Then he called \\nout, ‘All right, come here then. Let’s finally get rid of old \\nthings. And have a little consideration for me.’ The women \\nattended to him at once. They rushed to him, caressed him, \\nand quickly ended their letters.\\nThen all three left the apartment together, something \\nthey had not done for months now, and took the electric \\ntram into the open air outside the city. The car in which they \\nwere sitting by themselves was totally engulfed by the warm \\nsun. They talked to each other, leaning back comfortably \\nin their seats, about future prospects, and they discovered \\nthat on closer observation these were not at all bad, for all \\nthree had employment, about which they had not really \\nquestioned each other at all, which was extremely favorable \\n\\n\\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBoo k.comand with especially promising prospects. The greatest im -\\nprovement in their situation at this moment, of course, had \\nto come from a change of dwelling. Now they wanted to \\nrent an apartment smaller and cheaper but better situated \\nand generally more practical than the present one, which \\nGregor had found. While they amused themselves in this \\nway, it struck Mr. and Mrs. Samsa almost at the same mo -\\nment how their daughter, who was getting more animated \\nall the time, had blossomed recently, in spite of all the trou -\\nbles which had made her cheeks pale, into a beautiful and \\nvoluptuous young woman. Growing more silent and almost \\nunconsciously understanding each other in their glances, \\nthey thought that the time was now at hand to seek out a \\ngood honest man for her. And it was something of a con -\\nfirmation of their new dreams and good intentions when at \\nthe end of their journey the daughter first lifted herself up \\nand stretched her young body.\\n\\n', metadata={'source': './metamorph_text.txt'})]\n"
